You'll start with an overview of the Angular framework where TypeScript and ES6 are introduced. Next you'll see how to build an application (RestApp) using the in-memory module to mock an API that communicates with a rest API performing crud operations. This is followed by an application (AuthApp) that uses a third party service to provide authentication and authorization capabilities to handle registrations. You'll then build an application (BlogApp) that communicates with a MongoDB database in six parts. Part 1 covers MongoDB, how to install bootstrap, login service, and adding the logic of the form. Part 2 covers how to start the project on the server, create the database and AuthService, and save the user in the session. In Parts 3 and 4 you will learn to create the post collection, post component, and sharpen details. In Parts 5 and 6 you will study adding, editing, and deleting posts with testing.

TypeScript 4 Design Patterns and Best Practices will assist with understanding design patterns and learning best practices for producing scalable TypeScript applications. It will also serve as handy documentation for future maintainers. This book takes a hands-on approach to helping you get up and running with the implementation of TypeScript design patterns and associated methodologies for writing testable code. You'll start by exploring the practical aspects of TypeScript 4 and its new features. The book will then take you through traditional gang of four (GOF) design patterns, such as behavioral, creational, and structural in their classic and alternative forms, and show you how you can use them in real-world development projects. Once you've got to grips with traditional design patterns, you'll advance to learning about their functional programming and reactive programming counterparts and how they can be coupled to deliver better and more idiomatic TypeScript code. By the end of this TypeScript book, you'll be able to efficiently recognize when and how to use the right design patterns in any practical use case and gain the confidence to work on scalable and maintainable TypeScript projects of any size. What you will learn • Understand the role of design patterns and their significance • Explore all significant design patterns within the context of TypeScript • Find out how design patterns differ from design concepts • Understand how to put the principles of design patterns into practice • Discover additional patterns that stem from functional and reactive programming • Recognize common gotchas and antipatterns when developing TypeScript applications and understand how to avoid them Who this book is for If you're a developer looking to learn how to apply established design patterns to solve common programming problems instead of reinventing solutions, you'll find this book useful.

Then, there's ASP.NET Core 5, which is the fastest .NET web framework today. Together, Vue.js for the frontend and ASP.NET Core 5 for the backend make a powerful combination. This book follows a hands-on approach to implementing practical methodologies for building robust applications using ASP.NET Core 5 and Vue.js 3. The topics here are not deep dive and the book is intended for busy .NET developers who have limited time and want a quick implementation of a clean architecture with popular libraries. You’ll start by setting up your web app’s backend, guided by clean architecture, command query responsibility segregation (CQRS), mediator pattern, and Entity Framework Core 5. The book then shows you how to build the frontend application using best practices, state management with Vuex, Vuetify UI component libraries, Vuelidate for input validations, lazy loading with Vue Router, and JWT authentication. Later, you’ll focus on testing and deployment. All the tutorials in this book support Windows 10, macOS, and Linux users. By the end of this book, you’ll be able to build an enterprise full-stack web app, use the most common npm packages for Vue.js and NuGet packages for ASP.NET Core, and deploy Vue.js and ASP.NET Core to Azure App Service using GitHub Actions. What you will learnDiscover CQRS and mediator pattern in the ASP.NET Core 5 Web APIUse Serilog, MediatR, FluentValidation, and Redis in ASP.NETExplore common Vue.js packages such as Vuelidate, Vuetify, and VuexManage complex app states using the Vuex state management libraryWrite integration tests in ASP.NET Core using xUnit and FluentAssertionsDeploy your app to Microsoft Azure using the new GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)Who this book is for This app development book is for .NET developers who want to get started with Vue.js and build full-stack enterprise web applications. Web developers looking to build a proof-of-concept application quickly and pragmatically using their existing knowledge of ASP.NET Core as well as developers who want to write readable and maintainable code using TypeScript and the C# programming language will also find this book useful. The book assumes intermediate-level .NET knowledge along with an understanding of C# programming, JavaScript, and ECMAScript.<br><blockquote>This book follows a hands-on approach to implementing practical methodologies for building robust applications using ASP.NET Core 5 and Vue.js 3.</blockquote>",
