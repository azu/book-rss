For JavaScript developers, this book is the best way to learn how data structures and algorithms can be used to solve complex problems—and immediately implement them. For Javascript developers, this book is a one-stop-shop for learning the algorithms and data structures that solve and optimize complex problems. Covering everything from functional programming and abstract data types, to sorting and searching, lists, bags, binary trees, forests, heaps, and graphs—the author uses examples taken from coding challenges and interview questions, enabling readers to explore the real-world advantages of specific algorithms and data structures. Written and illustrated to be a developer’s go-to reference manual as well as for immediate on-the-job applications, performance—both from a theoretical point of view and a practical standpoint—is considered alongside every algorithm or data structure introduced. In addition to demonstrating best practices throughout the text, each chapter ends with a series of questions that amplify the preceding concepts and provide further examples for the reader to apply.

Like Python Crash Course, this hands-on guide is a must-have for anyone who wants to learn how to code from the ground up—this time using the popular JavaScript programming language. Learn JavaScript—Fast! JavaScript Crash Course is a fun-filled, fast-paced introduction to programming with JavaScript. Dive right in and you’ll be writing code, solving problems, and building working web applications and games in no time. You’ll start by learning fundamental programming concepts, such as variables, arrays, objects, functions, conditionals, loops, classes, and more. Aided by engaging examples and hands-on exercises, you’ll build on this foundation and combine JavaScript with HTML and CSS to create interactive web applications that you can run right away. Then you’ll put your new skills into play with three substantial projects: a Pong-style game with a virtual opponent, an app that generates electronic music, and a platform for visualizing data fetched from an API. Along the way, you’ll learn how to: • Update web pages in real time by manipulating the Document Object Model • Trigger functions in response to events like key presses and mouse clicks • Generate graphics and animations with JavaScript and HTML’s Canvas element • Visualize data with the D3.js library and scalable vector graphics (SVG) • Make electronic music with Tone.js and the Web Audio API If you’ve been thinking about digging into programming, JavaScript Crash Course will get you writing real programs fast.
