Although the initial focus of the language was to assist in the generation of dynamic web content, it soon found its way into numerous other applications. This book aims to cover the fundamentals of the language by providing a strong start for people who wish to start their journey to the JavaScript programming language. It provides the mandatory theoretical background, which is much needed for implementation of the exhaustive hands-on exercises and includes over 4000 lines of code for grasping a maximum understanding of the material. FEATURES A strong theoretical background and understanding of the fundamentals of the JavaScript language Hands-on and demo exercises at the end of every chapter Exercises, theory-based questions, MCQs and true/false questions for helping readers to evaluate their understanding from time to time A dedicated chapter providing extended case studies for using the language This book is targeted at undergraduate as well as postgraduate students who want to learn about front-end programming or who wish to learn a lightweight, easy-to-use programming language for working on their projects. For programmers having experience in other languages, it will serve as a quick summary to get a hold of a new language.<br><blockquote>This book aims to cover the fundamentals of the language by providing a strong start for people who wish to start their journey to the JavaScript programming language.</blockquote>",

The only technical requirement for using Blazor WebAssembly is a browser that supports WebAssembly, which, as of today, all modern browsers do. Blazor WebAssembly by Example is a project-based guide for learning how to build single-page web applications using the Blazor WebAssembly framework. This book emphasizes the practical over the theoretical by providing detailed step-by-step instructions for each project. You'll start by building simple standalone web applications and progress to developing more advanced hosted web applications with SQL Server backends. Each project covers a different aspect of the Blazor WebAssembly ecosystem, such as Razor components, JavaScript interop, event handling, application state, and dependency injection. The book is designed in such a way that you can complete the projects in any order. By the end of this book, you will have experience building a wide variety of single-page web applications with .NET, Blazor WebAssembly, and C#. What you will learn Discover the power of the C# language for both server-side and client-side web development Use the Blazor WebAssembly App project template to build your first Blazor WebAssembly application Use templated components and the Razor class library to build and share a modal dialog box Understand how to use JavaScript with Blazor WebAssembly Build a progressive web app (PWA) to enable native app-like performance and speed Understand dependency injection (DI) in .NET to build a shopping cart app Get to grips with .NET Web APIs by building a task manager app Who this book is for This book is for .NET web developers who are tired of constantly learning new JavaScript frameworks and wish to write web applications using Blazor WebAssembly, leveraging the power of .NET and C#.
