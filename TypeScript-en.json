Helps develop maintainable and scalable TypeScript code. DESCRIPTION This book provides a comprehensive guide to TypeScript, a programming language that extends JavaScript with powerful features like static typing, classes, and interfaces. The book is divided into thirteen chapters that cover everything from setting up a development environment to building an Angular app with TypeScript. We start with an introduction to TypeScript and its benefits and go on to explain how TypeScript can help developers write more maintainable, scalable code and catch errors before they make it to production. The book then dives into more technical topics like basic type annotations, using the TypeScript compiler, advanced features like enums and interfaces, and manipulating types. The book then discusses chapters on classes and control flow analysis that are particularly helpful for developers looking to build more complex applications. The book teaches by example, with numerous code examples that illustrate the main concepts and approaches towards writing TypeScript programs and codes, and finishes with a comprehensive practical example that shows step-by-step development of a modern web application using TypeScript and Angular. WHAT WILL YOU LEARN ● Learn how to create a new TypeScript project with default settings and configurations. ● Discover how to incorporate basic type-annotations into your code for improved clarity and accuracy. ● Explore the use of type-aliases, interfaces, and enums to write more organized and expressive TypeScript code. ● Gain knowledge on building modular and error-free applications in TypeScript. ● Discover how to leverage type-guards, classes, and other TypeScript utilities to write more robust code. ● Learn how to work with advanced features like generics and take your TypeScript skills to the next level. WHO IS THIS BOOK FOR? This book is targeted towards front-end developers who are familiar with JavaScript and are interested in expanding their skillset with TypeScript. Whether you are a beginner with little to no experience or an intermediate developer looking for a reference guide, this book is designed to help you supercharge your development and enhance your tooling. With its clear and concise explanations, it's perfect for those who are new to TypeScript and looking to gain a deeper understanding of its capabilities.

TypeScript 4 Design Patterns and Best Practices is a one-stop guide to help you learn design patterns and practices to develop scalable TypeScript applications. It will also serve as handy documentation for future maintainers. This book takes a hands-on approach to help you get up and running with the implementation of TypeScript design patterns and associated methodologies for writing testable code.
