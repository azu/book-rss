Nearly all online forum posts, books, online documentation, and libraries refer to the language as single threaded. Thanks to recent advancements in the language--such as the Atomics and SharedArrayBuffers objects and Web Workers in the browser--JavaScript is now a multi-threaded language. These features will go down as being the biggest paradigm shift for the world's most popular programming language. Multithreaded JavaScript explores the various features that JavaScript runtimes have at their disposal for implementing multithreaded programming, providing both practical real-world examples, as well as reference material. Learn what multithreaded programming is and how you can benefit from it Understand the differences between a web worker, a service worker, and a worker thread Know when and when not to use threads in an application Orchestrate communication between threads by leveraging the Atomics object Build high-performance applications using the knowledge you gain from this book Benchmark performance to learn if you'll benefit from multithreading<br><blockquote>Learn what multithreaded programming is and how you can benefit from it Understand the differences between a web worker, a service worker, and a worker thread Know when and when not to use threads in an application Orchestrate communication ...</blockquote>",

The only technical requirement for using Blazor WebAssembly is a browser that supports WebAssembly, which, as of today, all modern browsers do. Blazor WebAssembly by Example is a project-based guide for learning how to build single-page web applications using the Blazor WebAssembly framework. This book emphasizes the practical over the theoretical by providing detailed step-by-step instructions for each project. You'll start by building simple standalone web applications and progress to developing more advanced hosted web applications with SQL Server backends. Each project covers a different aspect of the Blazor WebAssembly ecosystem, such as Razor components, JavaScript interop, event handling, application state, and dependency injection. The book is designed in such a way that you can complete the projects in any order.
