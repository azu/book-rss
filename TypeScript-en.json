This updated version will show you how to build apps with React, Node.js or Django, and TypeScript, and how Webpack can be used to optimize and organize your code for deployment. You’ll begin by building a solid foundation of knowledge and quickly expand it by constructing three different real-world apps. These aren’t just simple, contrived examples but real apps that you can choose to install on your servers and use for real. You’ll also understand how Docker can be used to run the apps you build in a clear and well-defined way, all of which will be able to springboard you into creating more advanced apps on your own.

            "summary": "Explore what React, Node, Python, Django, TypeScript, Webpack, and Docker have to offer individually, and how they all fit together in modern app development. This updated version will show you how to build apps with React, Node.js or Django, and TypeScript, and how Webpack can be used to optimize and organize your code for deployment. You’ll begin by building a solid foundation of knowledge and quickly expand it by constructing three different real-world apps. These aren’t just simple, contrived examples but real apps that you can choose to install on your servers and use for real. You’ll also understand how Docker can be used to run the apps you build in a clear and well-defined way, all of which will be able to springboard you into creating more advanced apps on your own.

Spring Boot is the lightweight, nimbler cousin to the bigger Spring Framework, with plenty of \"bells and whistles.\" This updated edition includes coverage of Spring Native, which will help you speed up your Spring Boot applications, as well as messaging with Spring Boot, Spring GraphQL, Spring Data JDBC and reactive relational database connectivity (R2DBC) with SQL. This new edition also covers enhancements to actuator endpoints, MongoDB 4.0 support, layered JAR and WAR support, support to build OCI images using Cloud Native Build Packs, changes to the DataSource initialization mechanism, and how bean validation support has moved to a separate spring-boot-validation-starter module. This book will teach you how to work with relational and NoSQL databases for data accessibility using Spring Boot with Spring Data, how to persist data with the Java Persistence APIs (JPA), MyBatis, and much more. You'll learn how to enhance your native cloud or web applications with other APIs such as REST and how to build reactive web applications using Spring Boot with WebFlux. Finally, you'll learn how to test applications using JUnit 5, as well as how to secure and deploy your application or service to cloud providers like Heroku.
