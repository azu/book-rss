From JavaScript-specific object-oriented programming and inheritance, to combining JavaScript with HTML and other markup languages, expert instruction walks you through the fundamentals and beyond. This new fourth edition has been updated to cover ECMAScript 6 and 7 (also known as ES2015 and ES2016) and the major re-imagination and departure from ES 5.1; new frameworks and libraries, new techniques, new testing tools, and more are explained in detail for the professional developer, with a practical focus that helps you put your new skills to work on real-world projects. The latest—and most dramatic—ES release is already being incorporated into JavaScript engines in major browsers; this, coupled with the rise in mobile web traffic increasing demand for responsive, dynamic web design, means that all web developers need to update their skills—and this book is your ideal resource for quick, relevant guidance. Get up to date with ECMAScript 6 and 7, new frameworks, and new libraries Delve into web animation, emerging APIs, and build systems Test more effectively with mocks, unit tests, functional tests, and other tools Plan your builds for future ES releases Even if you think you know JavaScript, new ES releases bring big changes that will affect the way you work.

Join Matthew MacDonald, author of too-many-tech-books-to-count, as he enters the world of JavaScript-accompanied by friendly ninjas, cheating goblins, and at least one rude wizard. Develop your skills with 35 interactive exercises on CodePen. Best of all, there's no setup required (a web browser is all you need). Who needs another book about coding for kids? These days, you can't turn around twice without someone trying to teach you how to code. So why the heck did I write my own book? When my daughters started learning to code, I discovered that most tutorials were as dry as dust. If you wanted something more fun, you could play a coding game and write commands to move a character around a maze. But unlike real programming, there was no chance to be creative. There was no freedom. There was no invitation to build your own programs. Here's what makes this book different: Hands-on practice. If you want to learn a new skill, you need to practice. Otherwise, it's just a bunch of theory swimming around in your head. Friendly for beginners. If you're a beginner, it's not enough to learn the basics of a programming language like JavaScript. You also need to learn the concepts of programming at the same time. No setup required. The world is full of amazing frameworks, tools, and code editors. But who wants to install a bunch of software before you even get started? Tiny. I'm a programming nerd, so I like talking about things like Big O notation. But no one needs to be buried in theory at the start of their journey. In this book, every chapter is a bite-sized lesson that you can usually finish in one sitting. Kinda fun. Not everyone has the motivation to learn from an old-fashioned textbook. But who doesn't want to play dice with a cheating goblin? So I decided to make something of my own. Then I unleashed it on my family. This is the result of those experiments. Why JavaScript? JavaScript is a great first language for people learning to code. It's not because JavaScript is a great teaching language (it mostly isn't). It's because JavaScript is everywhere-on every operating system, every browser, and almost every electronic device that's more complicated than a toaster. That means you can effortlessly share your JavaScript programs with friends. Unlike all the rest of computing history, there's no downloading, installing, or configuring. And it doesn't hurt that JavaScript syntax is similar to many other professional languages, like Java and C#. That means the effort you spend to learn JavaScript is never wasted. Can adults read this book? Most certainly! However, this book assumes you're learning JavaScript and programming for the first time. If you already know a bit about programming, you'll probably prefer a guide that focuses on the JavaScript language without re-introducing the concepts you already know.<br><blockquote>Can adults read this book?

JavaScript is used by various software companies in the world, so much that many computer operations will not work without it. So, it's a great idea to try using it too. The most exciting feature of JavaScript is that it allows you to program using English-based commands, not numeric codes and that makes it a whole lot easier for humans to program. This means programmers can read and easily understand the computer language. Another uniqueness of JavaScript is that the producing company always update the language so that modern operations and newly developed patterns can be easily programmed into a computer. That sounds great, and that is a reason you should trust JavaScript. But that certainly comes with a load of problems. It makes it all the more complicated for you to try using JavaScript. The first is that there are vital skills you need in order to navigate JavaScript as an expert. If you are a beginner who hasn't even run the JavaScript application by accident or you have some raw idea, the book attached below can help you explore easily. It will provide details of data structure, basic programming structure, advance programming structure, various kinds of test execution and so many others. It is also written in a simple and relative style that would answer every question you have at every turn of practice. This book is ideal for you as a starter who knows nothing about programming. Step by step, you will find all the basics of computer coding with JavaScript. So, be sure reading this means you are training to become a top class programmer who can confidently code computers with a sound knowledge of JavaScript Basics. Among others, you will learn: - What is JavaScript? (JavaScript in XHTML documents, in browsers, etc.) - Why JavaScript? (Types of JavaScript execution, how to create one, Python Vs Java and so on) - Basic Programming Structure - Advance Programming Structure - Data Structures: Objects and Arrays. - Higher Order Functions - What is JavaScript Cookies?

            "content_html": "JavaScript has become the most popular programming language in the world. It has attained that position by being easy to use and powerful in its capabilities. It wasn't always that way but today it can be used to build virtually any application you desire. With the addition of HTML5 and CSS3, it allows for wonderfully animated and powerful web sites and applications without having to use other technologies such as Adobe Flash. JavaScript has also become much more standardized across the multiple browsers in use today. With the recent proliferation of libraries and frameworks that many developers use, the focus has shifted towards these new tools, but they still rely on native JavaScript. And these libraries and frameworks can greatly increase the size of your code as well as slowing down performance. This book covers best practices for coding in straight JavaScript as well as pointing out many areas for optimization. The goal is to help programmers produce smaller and faster JavaScript applications. Even programmers using frameworks and libraries can benefit from understanding the performance trade-offs they make when using those tools.<br><blockquote>This book covers best practices for coding in straight JavaScript as well as pointing out many areas for optimization.
