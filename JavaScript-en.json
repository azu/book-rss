The book is extremely user-friendly. It assumes no programming experience and helps the students to learn the JavaScript in step by step manner with the help of illustrative examples. The first two units cover the fundamental concepts of JavaScript such as variables, operators, control structures, arrays, functions and strings. In the third unit, the concept of form and event handling is discussed. This feature of JavaScript help us to design the interactive web page with graphical user interface. In the next subsequent chapter, the book demonstrates how to create and manage cookies, how to create browser history, implementation of form validation with the help of regular expressions, creating rollover effects and creating and handling frames. At the end, the book illustrates creation of banner, management of status bar and creation of slideshows using JavaScript. This book serves the purpose of teaching JavaScript in the simplest and easiest manner.<br><blockquote>At the end, the book illustrates creation of banner, management of status bar and creation of slideshows using JavaScript.

This book is written in a practical and easy way and offers theory and plenty of practical material. There are explanations and practical examples that help beginners learn fast. Instead of diving deeper into lengthy and boring texts, I tried to get straight to the point for each topic. I have defined each topic and added an easy to understand explanation to help you understand the concepts and the main keywords that will do the magic in the code. Coupled with the explanation, you will find a code snippet for each topic that is custom written and has been tested for errors. You can copy them and load them up on a web browser to see the results, or you can simply edit them and customize them to understand them well. The choice is yours. First book is written in an orderly form with beginner-level topics and progressively tougher topics later on. Second book is focusing on React JS, this guide is aimed at those who already have a programming background and some experience in programming for the web but need to brush up on their skills and learn new ones. Third book will take you through the important concepts involved in using Node.js to build your server-side applications. Each chapter is self-contained with its own practical but simple examples to show you how it works. By the end of this book, you will have all the knowledge you need to put together your own web application!Here is a rundown of the contents of the book.
