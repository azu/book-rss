This book highlights how Typescript works with JavaScript and its frameworks, giving it greater functionality, especially for larger enterprise projects. You'll start by reviewing some fundamentals such as how to run a TypeScript file and compile it to JavaScript as well as understand how it sits within the full ecosystem alongside React, Redux, Angular and Webpack. Using a practical project-led approach, you'll go through key concepts and aspects of Typescript such as compilers, arrays, classes and interfaces. Once you complete the fundamental basics, you'll move onto more complex topics like advanced types. You'll also learn about Decorators, which are a must-have feature in Angular. The book then presents a small To-do list project followed by a larger 'Drag and Drop' project. You'll see how to divide the drag and drop project into small manageable modules and learn to make the project more efficient with Webpack. Lastly, you'll create two more React projects, a party app with React and then one with React and Redux. Typescript Basics reveals how this JavaScript extension is currently the fastest growing language for web development with more and more developers and companies looking to utilize and adopt it within their current workflows and projects.

This web app development book takes a hands-on, project-based approach to provide you with all the tools and techniques that web developers need to create, debug, and deploy efficient web applications using ASP.NET Core and Angular. The fifth edition has been updated to cover advanced topics such as Minimal APIs, Web APIs with GraphQL, real-time updates with SignalR, and new features in .NET 6 and Angular 13. You begin by building a data model with Entity Framework Core, alongside utilizing the Entity Core Fluent API and EntityTypeConfiguration class. You'll learn how to fetch and display data and handle user input with Angular reactive forms and front-end and back-end validators for maximum effect. Later, you will perform advanced debugging and explore the unit testing features provided by xUnit.net (.NET 6) and Jasmine, as well as Karma for Angular. After adding authentication and authorization to your apps, you will explore progressive web applications, learning about their technical requirements, testing processes, and how to convert a standard web application to a PWA. By the end of this web development book, you will understand how to tie together the front-end and back-end to build and deploy secure and robust web applications.

TypeScript 4 Design Patterns and Best Practices is a one-stop guide to help you learn design patterns and practices to develop scalable TypeScript applications. It will also serve as handy documentation for future maintainers. This book takes a hands-on approach to help you get up and running with the implementation of TypeScript design patterns and associated methodologies for writing testable code. You'll start by exploring the practical aspects of TypeScript 4 and its new features. The book will then take you through the traditional gang of four (GOF) design patterns in their classic and alternative form and show you how to use them in real-world development projects. Once you've got to grips with traditional design patterns, you'll advance to learning about their functional programming and reactive programming counterparts and how to couple them to deliver better and more idiomatic TypeScript code. By the end of this TypeScript book, you'll be able to efficiently recognize when and how to use the right design patterns in any practical use case and gain the confidence to work on scalable and maintainable TypeScript projects of any size. What you will learn Understand the role of design patterns and their significance Explore all significant design patterns within the context of TypeScript Analyze, and develop classical design patterns in TypeScript Find out how design patterns differ from design concepts Understand how to put the principles of design patterns into practice Discover additional patterns that stem from functional and reactive programming Who this book is for If you're a TypeScript developer looking to learn how to apply established design patterns to solve common programming problems instead of reinventing solutions, you'll find this book useful.
