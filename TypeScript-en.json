TypeScript 4 Design Patterns and Best Practices will assist with understanding design patterns and learning best practices for producing scalable TypeScript applications. It will also serve as handy documentation for future maintainers. This book takes a hands-on approach to helping you get up and running with the implementation of TypeScript design patterns and associated methodologies for writing testable code. You'll start by exploring the practical aspects of TypeScript 4 and its new features. The book will then take you through traditional gang of four (GOF) design patterns, such as behavioral, creational, and structural in their classic and alternative forms, and show you how you can use them in real-world development projects. Once you've got to grips with traditional design patterns, you'll advance to learning about their functional programming and reactive programming counterparts and how they can be coupled to deliver better and more idiomatic TypeScript code. By the end of this TypeScript book, you'll be able to efficiently recognize when and how to use the right design patterns in any practical use case and gain the confidence to work on scalable and maintainable TypeScript projects of any size. What you will learn • Understand the role of design patterns and their significance • Explore all significant design patterns within the context of TypeScript • Find out how design patterns differ from design concepts • Understand how to put the principles of design patterns into practice • Discover additional patterns that stem from functional and reactive programming • Recognize common gotchas and antipatterns when developing TypeScript applications and understand how to avoid them Who this book is for If you're a developer looking to learn how to apply established design patterns to solve common programming problems instead of reinventing solutions, you'll find this book useful.

It will also serve as handy documentation for future maintainers. This book takes a hands-on approach to helping you get up and running with the implementation of TypeScript design patterns and associated methodologies for writing testable code. You'll start by exploring the practical aspects of TypeScript 4 and its new features. The book will then take you through traditional gang of four (GOF) design patterns, such as behavioral, creational, and structural in their classic and alternative forms, and show you how you can use them in real-world development projects. Once you've got to grips with traditional design patterns, you'll advance to learning about their functional programming and reactive programming counterparts and how they can be coupled to deliver better and more idiomatic TypeScript code. By the end of this TypeScript book, you'll be able to efficiently recognize when and how to use the right design patterns in any practical use case and gain the confidence to work on scalable and maintainable TypeScript projects of any size. What you will learn • Understand the role of design patterns and their significance • Explore all significant design patterns within the context of TypeScript • Find out how design patterns differ from design concepts • Understand how to put the principles of design patterns into practice • Discover additional patterns that stem from functional and reactive programming • Recognize common gotchas and antipatterns when developing TypeScript applications and understand how to avoid them Who this book is for If you're a developer looking to learn how to apply established design patterns to solve common programming problems instead of reinventing solutions, you'll find this book useful. You're not expected to have prior knowledge of design patterns. Basic TypeScript knowledge is all you need to get started with this book. Table of Contents • Getting Started With Typescript 4 • Typescript Principles and Use Cases • Creational Design Patterns • Structural Design Patterns • Behavioral Design Patterns • Functional Programming Design Concepts • Reactive Design Patterns • Developing Robust and Modern Typescript Applications • Anti Patterns and Workarounds",

It's known to provide much-needed stability and a rich tooling ecosystem for building production-ready web and mobile apps. This recipe-based guide enables you to learn Angular concepts in depth using a step-by-step approach. You'll explore a wide range of recipes across key tasks in web development that will help you build high-performance apps. The book starts by taking you through core Angular concepts such as Angular components, directives, and services to get you ready for building frontend web apps. You'll develop web components with Angular and go on to cover advanced concepts such as dynamic components loading and state management with NgRx for achieving real-time performance. Later chapters will focus on recipes for effectively testing your Angular apps to make them fail-safe, before progressing to techniques for optimizing your app's performance. Finally, you'll create Progressive Web Apps (PWA) with Angular to provide an intuitive experience for users. By the end of this Angular book, you'll be able to create full-fledged, professional-looking Angular apps and have the skills you need for frontend development, which are crucial for an enterprise Angular developer. What you will learn Gain a better understanding of how components, services, and directives work in Angular Understand how to create Progressive Web Apps using Angular from scratch Build rich animations and add them to your Angular apps Manage your app's data reactivity using RxJS Implement state management for your Angular apps with NgRx Optimize the performance of your new and existing web apps Write fail-safe unit tests and end-to-end tests for your web apps using Jest and Cypress Get familiar with Angular CDK components for designing effective Angular components Who this book is for The book is for intermediate-level Angular web developers looking for actionable solutions to common problems in Angular enterprise development.
