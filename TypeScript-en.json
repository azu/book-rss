Set during the Nixon years, it chronicles the journey of Robert English as he lays down old grief, finds and loses new love, and changes paths as he sets out on an odyssey to find himself and his place in the world. This well-written coming-of-age epistolary explores important truths about the transition from childhood to what comes after in a style reminiscent of J.D. Salinger. With a poet’s eye for detail and language, William Walsh has given us a story worth reading and remembering. —Raymond L.

William Walsh’s Lakewood takes us deeply into Robert’s wounded psyche as he navigates the hauntings of his past and the uncertainty of the future. His tribulations in love and betrayal, immersion into great novels, and discovery of long hidden secrets impart lessons for Robert and for Walsh’s readers of our capacity to understand and forgive ourselves and one another.
