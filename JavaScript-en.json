Updated for the latest React release, the second edition of this hands-on guide shows you how to build React components and organize them into maintainable large-scale apps. If you're familiar with JavaScript syntax, you're ready to get started. Through the course of this book, author Stoyan Stefanov helps web developers and programmers build a complete single-page application. You'll quickly learn why some developers consider React the key to the web app development puzzle. Set up React and write your first \"Hello, World\" web app Create and use custom React components alongside generic DOM components Build a data table component that lets you edit, sort, search, and export its contents Master the JSX syntax Use built-in Hooks and create your own custom ones Manage the app's data flow with reducers and contexts Use Create React App to take care of the build process and focus on React itself Build a complete custom app that lets you store data on the client<br><blockquote>If you&#39;re familiar with JavaScript syntax, you&#39;re ready to get started.

By using test-driven development (TDD), you'll write code that's easy to understand, retains its elegance, and works for months, even years, to come. With this indispensable guide, you'll learn how to use TDD with three different languages: Go, JavaScript, and Python. Author Saleem Siddiqui shows you how to tackle domain complexity using a unit test-driven approach. TDD partitions requirements into small, implementable features, enabling you to solve problems irrespective of the languages and frameworks you use. With Learning Test-Driven Development at your side, you'll learn how to incorporate TDD into your regular coding practice. This book helps you: Use TDD's divide-and-conquer approach to tame domain complexity Understand how TDD works across languages, testing frameworks, and domain concepts Learn how TDD enables continuous integration Support refactoring and redesign with TDD Learn how to write a simple and effective unit test harness in JavaScript Set up a continuous integration environment with the unit tests produced during TDD Write clean, uncluttered code using TDD in Go, JavaScript, and Python<br><blockquote>This book helps you: Use TDD&#39;s divide-and-conquer approach to tame domain complexity Understand how TDD works across languages, testing frameworks, and domain concepts Learn how TDD enables continuous integration Support refactoring and ...</blockquote>",

It's easier than ever to build user interactions with the Webpacker gem and Stimulus. You can add great front-end flair without much extra complication. Add React to build an even more extensive set of client-side features. Structure your code for different levels of client-side needs with these powerful options. Add to your toolkit today! It's hard to have a Rails application without integrating some client-side logic. But client-side coding tools, and the Rails tools for integrating with them, all change continuously. Rails 6 simplifies client-side integration with the Webpacker gem. It's the default tool for building client-side assets for use by web browsers. Learn how to use Rails 6 and Webpacker to build rich front-end logic into your Rails applications. The job is even easier with Stimulus, a library that brings Rails conventions to JavaScript tools. Add in some React, a popular framework that automatically updates the browser when your data changes. Learn the basics of webpack, Webpacker, and TypeScript, and add pizazz to your application. Structure your web application to best manage your state. Learn how to interact with data on the server while still keeping the user experience interactive. Use the type system in TypeScript to expand on JavaScript and help prevent error conditions. Debug and test your front-end application with tools specific to each framework. There are a lot of ways to do client-side coding, and Rails is here to help. What You Need: This book requires Ruby on Rails 6.0+, React 16.8.0+. Other dependencies will be added by Rails.<br><blockquote>Debug and test your front-end application with tools specific to each framework.
