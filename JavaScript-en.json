            "content_html": "A new version of the classic and widely used text adapted for the JavaScript programming language. Since the publication of its first edition in 1984 and its second edition in 1996, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) has influenced computer science curricula around the world. Widely adopted as a textbook, the book has its origins in a popular entry-level computer science course taught by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman at MIT. SICP introduces the reader to central ideas of computation by establishing a series of mental models for computation. Earlier editions used the programming language Scheme in their program examples. This new version of the second edition has been adapted for JavaScript. The first three chapters of SICP cover programming concepts that are common to all modern high-level programming languages. Chapters four and five, which used Scheme to formulate language processors for Scheme, required significant revision. Chapter four offers new material, in particular an introduction to the notion of program parsing. The evaluator and compiler in chapter five introduce a subtle stack discipline to support return statements (a prominent feature of statement-oriented languages) without sacrificing tail recursion. The JavaScript programs included in the book run in any implementation of the language that complies with the ECMAScript 2020 specification, using the JavaScript package sicp provided by the MIT Press website.<br><blockquote>Widely adopted as a textbook, the book has its origins in a popular entry-level computer science course taught by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman at MIT.</blockquote>",

            "content_html": "If you are looking for practical, easy to implement measures to enhance your site’s performance and improve speed and page load times, yet are still unsure where to start or how to develop your strategy, this book on Web Performance Optimization is the answer. Focusing on practical areas including page speed optimization, compression, minification, localization, SEO, and image optimization, this comprehensive book has several tips and examples that will walk you through the process of understanding web performance requirements for your site and formulating an implementation process to meet those standards. Improving your website performance starts from the very first day you launch it. And since your business marketing and operation plans might constantly expand and evolve, committing to better user experience and search engine optimization requires consistency and a systematic approach. True optimization has to be regarded as a daily duty that involves monitoring changes in rates, rebranding, and redefining the site regularly. With the help of this book, you will understand essential web performance principles that will enable you to write clean code from scratch and optimize existing code with performance in mind. By mastering simple steps of website optimization, you can expect to put your product on the map and enable heavier and more organic traffic in less time. A particular area of focus for this book is technical optimization. This book will guide you through standard modules and methods that you may implement to raise off-page efficiency, such as learning how to monitor sitemap errors, console errors, keep your code and URL clean, and ensure good search engine crawlability. In order to serve your target audience with materials they would like, you need to understand who your viewers are—this book helps you unravel just that by discussing analytics tools at length.
