In this series of books we will overcome the problem of having to write code for Android and iOS by using React Native. React Native is a framework developed by Facebook for creating native-style apps for iOS & Android under one common language, JavaScript. Initially, Facebook only developed React Native to support iOS. However with its recent support of the Android operating system, the library can now render mobile UIs for both platforms. Why React Native ? Not only react native allows you to create cross platform applications but react native also makes updating apps simple through over-the-app updates. Over the air update in react native is achieved through technologies such as CodePush with a few lines of code. Armed with React Native you’ll finally be able to make apps of your choice in no time and I’m glad to show you what React Native can do through this series of books. In this book we will learn the core concepts of Javascript to help us with our React Native Journey.<br><blockquote>In this book we will learn the core concepts of Javascript to help us with our React Native Journey.</blockquote>",
