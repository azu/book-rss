This book learns about developing web services based on REST architecture using Deno. Deno is the latest server runtime environment for typescript and javascript in addition to node.js which is well known to date. Yes, deno was created by Ryan Dahl who created node.js itself, will deno be the next node.js successor? Of course there are reasons behind developing a new runtime for executing typescript and javascript. Architecturally, for deno runtime javascript it still uses Google Engine V8 just like the previous node.js, but this time the deno was built using Rust and TypeScript languages, while node.js was built with C ++ and JavaScript. For asynchronous runtime and event driven deno use the open source library, Tokio. Deno support typescript built-in or out of the box in the sense can be used directly without having to first configure settings, unlike node.js. The use of javascript is also supported in addition to typescript. Deno is more secure than node.js, because by default deno cannot access files, environment access, network, without explicit declaration. What is discussed in this book? Here are the points: - Introduction and installation of deno along with visual studio code as a code editor - Use standard modules for http servers - Use of third party modules such as oak to handle requests, responses, and routing - Creating a controller and routing for CRUD functionality for the postgresql database - Using Denon to automate the compilation and deno project running - Implementation of middleware for authentication - Implement bcrypt module for password hashing - Implementation of authentication using JWT - Implementation of https server - Refactoring module - Repository pattern - Access user defined functions and stored procedures in postgresql - Bundling project - The use of PM2 as monitoring tools - The use of denoDB ORM Hopefully this book can be another alternative as a source of learning exercises, tutorials, or references for those who want to learn Deno programming.<br><blockquote>This book learns about developing web services based on REST architecture using Deno.</blockquote>",

Node.js is a scalable application server that is used in thousands of websites, while GraphQL is becoming the standard way for large websites to provide data and services to their users. Together, these technologies, when reinforced with the capabilities of TypeScript, provide a cutting-edge stack for complete web application development. This book takes a hands-on approach to implementing modern web technologies and the associated methodologies for building full-stack apps. You'll begin by gaining a strong understanding of TypeScript and how to use it to build high-quality web apps. The chapters that follow delve into client-side development with React using the new Hooks API and Redux. Next, you'll get to grips with server-side development with Express, including authentication with Redis-based sessions and accessing databases with TypeORM. The book will then show you how to use Apollo GraphQL to build web services for your full-stack app. Later, you'll learn how to build GraphQL schemas and integrate them with React using Hooks. Finally, you'll focus on how to deploy your application onto an NGINX server using the AWS cloud. By the end of this book, you'll be able to build and deploy complete high-performance web applications using React, Node, and GraphQL.

In this book, we take you on a fun, hands-on and pragmatic journey to master Angular from a web development point of view. You'll start building Angular apps within minutes. Every section is written in a bite-sized manner and straight to the point as I don't want to waste your time (and most certainly mine) on the content you don't need. In the end, you will have what it takes to develop a real-life app. About the Reader This book is for developers with basic familiarity with HTML, CSS, Javascript and object-oriented programming.
