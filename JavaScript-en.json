It's easier than ever to build user interactions with the Webpacker gem and Stimulus. You can add great front-end flair without much extra complication. Add React to build an even more extensive set of client-side features. Structure your code for different levels of client-side needs with these powerful options. Add to your toolkit today! It's hard to have a Rails application without integrating some client-side logic. But client-side coding tools, and the Rails tools for integrating with them, all change continuously. Rails 6 simplifies client-side integration with the Webpacker gem. It's the default tool for building client-side assets for use by web browsers. Learn how to use Rails 6 and Webpacker to build rich front-end logic into your Rails applications. The job is even easier with Stimulus, a library that brings Rails conventions to JavaScript tools. Add in some React, a popular framework that automatically updates the browser when your data changes. Learn the basics of webpack, Webpacker, and TypeScript, and add pizazz to your application. Structure your web application to best manage your state. Learn how to interact with data on the server while still keeping the user experience interactive. Use the type system in TypeScript to expand on JavaScript and help prevent error conditions. Debug and test your front-end application with tools specific to each framework. There are a lot of ways to do client-side coding, and Rails is here to help. What You Need: This book requires Ruby on Rails 6.0+, React 16.8.0+. Other dependencies will be added by Rails.<br><blockquote>Debug and test your front-end application with tools specific to each framework.

This book is written in a practical and easy way and offers theory and plenty of practical material. There are explanations and practical examples that help beginners learn fast. Instead of diving deeper into lengthy and boring texts, I tried to get straight to the point for each topic. I have defined each topic and added an easy to understand explanation to help you understand the concepts and the main keywords that will do the magic in the code. Coupled with the explanation, you will find a code snippet for each topic that is custom written and has been tested for errors. You can copy them and load them up on a web browser to see the results, or you can simply edit them and customize them to understand them well. The choice is yours. First book is written in an orderly form with beginner-level topics and progressively tougher topics later on. Second book is focusing on React JS, this guide is aimed at those who already have a programming background and some experience in programming for the web but need to brush up on their skills and learn new ones. Third book will take you through the important concepts involved in using Node.js to build your server-side applications. Each chapter is self-contained with its own practical but simple examples to show you how it works. By the end of this book, you will have all the knowledge you need to put together your own web application!Here is a rundown of the contents of the book. JavaScript Use Cases Variables Constants Prompts Conditionals Arrays Strings JavaScript For and While Loops Functions Objects Classes Learn how to set up your React JS environment.
