This full-color book is packed with inspiring code examples, infographics and photography that not only teach you the PHP language and how to work with databases, but also show you how to build new applications from scratch. It demonstrates practical techniques that you will recognize from popular sites where visitors can: Register as a member and log in Create articles, posts and profiles that are saved in a database Upload their own images and files Automatically receive email notifications Like and comment on posts. To show you how to apply the skills you learn, you will build a complete content management system, enhanced with features that are commonly seen on social networks. Written by best-selling HTML & CSS and JavaScript & jQuery author Jon Duckett, this book uses a unique visual approach, with step-by-step instructions, practical code examples and pro tips that will teach you how to build modern database-driven websites using PHP.<br><blockquote>Written by best-selling HTML &amp; CSS and JavaScript &amp; jQuery author Jon Duckett, this book uses a unique visual approach, with step-by-step instructions, practical code examples and pro tips that will teach you how to build modern database ...</blockquote>",

Nearly all online forum posts, books, online documentation, and libraries refer to the language as single threaded. Thanks to recent advancements in the language--such as the Atomics and SharedArrayBuffers objects and Web Workers in the browser--JavaScript is now a multi-threaded language. These features will go down as being the biggest paradigm shift for the world's most popular programming language. Multithreaded JavaScript explores the various features that JavaScript runtimes have at their disposal for implementing multithreaded programming, providing both practical real-world examples, as well as reference material. Learn what multithreaded programming is and how you can benefit from it Understand the differences between a web worker, a service worker, and a worker thread Know when and when not to use threads in an application Orchestrate communication between threads by leveraging the Atomics object Build high-performance applications using the knowledge you gain from this book Benchmark performance to learn if you'll benefit from multithreading<br><blockquote>Learn what multithreaded programming is and how you can benefit from it Understand the differences between a web worker, a service worker, and a worker thread Know when and when not to use threads in an application Orchestrate communication ...</blockquote>",
