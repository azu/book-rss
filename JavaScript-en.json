The only technical requirement for using Blazor WebAssembly is a browser that supports WebAssembly, which, as of today, all modern browsers do. Blazor WebAssembly by Example is a project-based guide for learning how to build single-page web applications using the Blazor WebAssembly framework. This book emphasizes the practical over the theoretical by providing detailed step-by-step instructions for each project. You'll start by building simple standalone web applications and progress to developing more advanced hosted web applications with SQL Server backends. Each project covers a different aspect of the Blazor WebAssembly ecosystem, such as Razor components, JavaScript interop, event handling, application state, and dependency injection. The book is designed in such a way that you can complete the projects in any order. By the end of this book, you will have experience building a wide variety of single-page web applications with .NET, Blazor WebAssembly, and C#. What you will learn Discover the power of the C# language for both server-side and client-side web development Use the Blazor WebAssembly App project template to build your first Blazor WebAssembly application Use templated components and the Razor class library to build and share a modal dialog box Understand how to use JavaScript with Blazor WebAssembly Build a progressive web app (PWA) to enable native app-like performance and speed Understand dependency injection (DI) in .NET to build a shopping cart app Get to grips with .NET Web APIs by building a task manager app Who this book is for This book is for .NET web developers who are tired of constantly learning new JavaScript frameworks and wish to write web applications using Blazor WebAssembly, leveraging the power of .NET and C#. The book assumes beginner-level knowledge of the C# language, .NET framework, Microsoft Visual Studio, and web development concepts.<br><blockquote>By the end of this book, you will have experience building a wide variety of single-page web applications with .NET, Blazor WebAssembly, and C#.

            "content_html": "Applied User Data Collection and Analysis Using JavaScript and PHP is designed to provide the technical skills and competency to gather a wide range of user data from web applications in both active and passive methods. This is done by providing the reader with real-world examples of how a variety of different JavaScript and PHP based libraries can be used to gather data using custom feedback forms and embedded data gathering tools. Once data has been gathered, this book explores the process of working with numerical data, text analysis, visualization approaches, statistics and rolling out developed applications to both data analysists and users alike. Using the collected data, this book aims to provide a deeper understanding of user behavior and interests allowing application developers to further enhance web application development. Key Features: Complete real-world examples of gathering data from users and web environments Offers readers the fundamentals of text analysis using JavaScript and PHP Allows the user to understand and harness JavaScript data visualization tools Integration of new and existing data sources into a single bespoke web-based analysis environment Author Bio: Dr. Kyle Goslin is currently a Lecturer in Computing at the Technological University Dublin in Ireland, specializing in web application development, information retrieval, text analysis and data visualization. Kyle has taught for over 10 years at third level in Ireland, teaching a wide range of web development related subjects. During this time, he has been involved in several different web-based data driven start-up companies with the aim of reducing time to market for businesses. Kyle has contributed to several different open-source learning platforms with the aim of making education accessible to all learners by aiding both teachers and students. Kyle has developed and defended a number of different third level computing courses validated by Quality and Qualifications Ireland. He has published peer-reviewed articles relating to information retrieval, text analysis and learning environments.
