            "summary": "An example-driven guide covering modern web app development techniques and emerging technologies such as WebAssembly, Service Workers, and Svelte.js to build faster, secure, and scalable apps Key Features Discover effective techniques for accessing DOM, minimizing painting, and using a V8 engine to optimize JavaScript Understand what makes the web tick and create apps that look and feel like native desktop applications Explore modern JavaScript frameworks like Svelte.js for building next-gen web apps Book Description High-performance web development is all about cutting through the complexities in different layers of a web app and building services and APIs that improve the speed and performance of your apps on the browser. With emerging web technologies, building scalable websites and sustainable web apps is smoother than ever. This book starts by taking you through the web frontend, popular web development practices, and the latest version of ES and JavaScript. You'll work with Node.js and learn how to build web apps without a framework. The book consists of three hands-on examples that help you understand JavaScript applications at both the server-side and the client-side using Node.js and Svelte.js. Each chapter covers modern techniques such as DOM manipulation and V8 engine optimization to strengthen your understanding of the web. Finally, you’ll delve into advanced topics such as CI/CD and how you can harness their capabilities to speed up your web development dramatically. By the end of this web development book, you'll have understood how the JavaScript landscape has evolved, not just for the frontend but also for the backend, and be ready to use new tools and techniques to solve common web problems.

You need have no previous knowledge of any scripting language so it's ideal for the newcomer to JavaScript. By the end of this book you will have gained a sound understanding of JavaScript and be able to add exciting dynamic scripts to your own web pages. JavaScript in easy steps, 6th edition begins by explaining how to easily incorporate JavaScript code in an HTML document. Examples demonstrate how to use built-in JavaScript functions to work with Math, date and time, random numbers, cookies, text strings, and elements of web pages via the Document Object Model (DOM). You will learn how JavaScript is used with HTML submission forms and how JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is used for asynchronous browser-server communication. The book examples provide clear syntax-highlighted code showing how to create behaviors for an HTML document to endow components with interactive functionality, to illustrate each aspect of JavaScript. JavaScript in easy steps, 6th edition has an easy-to-follow style that will appeal to anyone who wants to add functionality to their web pages. It will appeal to programmers who want to quickly add JavaScript to their skills set, and to the student who is studying website design at school or college, and to those seeking a career in web development who need an understanding of client-side scripting.
