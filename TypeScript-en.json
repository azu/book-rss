TypeScript combines the typing features of C# or Java with the flexibility of JavaScript, reducing typing errors and providing an easier path to JavaScript development. Author Adam Freeman explains how to get the most from TypeScript 4 in this second edition of his best-selling book. He begins by describing the TypeScript language and the benefits it offers and then shows you how to use TypeScript in real-world scenarios, including development with the DOM API, and popular frameworks such as Angular and React. He starts from the nuts-and-bolts and builds up to the most advanced and sophisticated features. Each topic is covered clearly and concisely, and is packed with the details you need to be effective. The most important features are given a no-nonsense, in-depth treatment and chapters include common problems and teach you how to avoid them.

It demonstrates the features available in both of the mentioned Azure services and discusses them in detail with some real-world examples. Reading a csv file and write to a Cosmos DB table store, Read emails using Microsoft Graph API and save them in a Cosmos DB, Cosmos DB trigger function to send SMS notifications to clients, A queue trigger to create new nodes in the Cosmos DB graph data store are some of them. You will be able to see the above case studies with code samples implemented in C# .NET Core, TypeScript, and Python. It consists of a very basic example, two intermediate samples, then and an advanced level one. You will experience the triggers and input/output bindings available for a function, like queue trigger, blob trigger, and Cosmos DB trigger to name a few. Also, you will be able to see some interesting features available in Azure functions like performance optimizations, scalability of a function app, geographical distribution of the function in different locations, error handling, writing unit tests for the functions to avoid breaking changes, how to ensure a function app is secure, and then how to deploy a function, and monitor and troubleshoot a function app. At the end of this book, you will gain strong experience in using Azure functions and how to manage serverless applications seamlessly without any failure with utmost performance. KEY FEATURES ● Expert-led coverage on integrating Azure functions ● Industry-proven examples and best practices on implementation of Azure Cosmos DB ● Learn to work on performance optimization and error handling ● Integration of Azure function with other Azure services WHAT YOU WILL LEARN ● You will be able to create an Azure function and integrate it with many Azure services including the Azure Cosmos DB ● You will get experience implementing a function using programming languages like C# .NET Core, TypeScript, and Python. ● You will get hands-on experience on the performance optimizing of a function, how to scale them, how to apply security to the function app, error handling and testing in a function.

This book learns about developing web services based on REST architecture using Deno. Deno is the latest server runtime environment for typescript and javascript in addition to node.js which is well known to date. Yes, deno was created by Ryan Dahl who created node.js itself, will deno be the next node.js successor? Of course there are reasons behind developing a new runtime for executing typescript and javascript. Architecturally, for deno runtime javascript it still uses Google Engine V8 just like the previous node.js, but this time the deno was built using Rust and TypeScript languages, while node.js was built with C ++ and JavaScript. For asynchronous runtime and event driven deno use the open source library, Tokio. Deno support typescript built-in or out of the box in the sense can be used directly without having to first configure settings, unlike node.js. The use of javascript is also supported in addition to typescript. Deno is more secure than node.js, because by default deno cannot access files, environment access, network, without explicit declaration. What is discussed in this book? Here are the points: - Introduction and installation of deno along with visual studio code as a code editor - Use standard modules for http servers - Use of third party modules such as oak to handle requests, responses, and routing - Creating a controller and routing for CRUD functionality for the postgresql database - Using Denon to automate the compilation and deno project running - Implementation of middleware for authentication - Implement bcrypt module for password hashing - Implementation of authentication using JWT - Implementation of https server - Refactoring module - Repository pattern - Access user defined functions and stored procedures in postgresql - Bundling project - The use of PM2 as monitoring tools - The use of denoDB ORM Hopefully this book can be another alternative as a source of learning exercises, tutorials, or references for those who want to learn Deno programming.<br><blockquote>This book learns about developing web services based on REST architecture using Deno.</blockquote>",
