You’ll learn how to work with JavaScript objects, creating and setting properties, defining and using methods and the way objects are used in the Document Object Model (DOM). All while kicking serious zombie tuchus. Speaking of the DOM you’ll become comfortable working with it, selecting elements out of it, creating elements and adding them to it and removing any apocalyptic elements that might slip through. Once you have all that under your post-apocalyptic utility belt you’ll then be introduced to events, event handlers and how to utilize them. By the end of this book you should be ready to manipulate a web page into post-apocalyptic submission (which is like normal submission except it’s, you know, like, after the apocalypse). How You'll Learn to Smack Zombies Around You won't just passively take in the view, like a zombie shuffling across the mainland. You’ll have plenty of combat practice with analogies, examples, and code tutorials you can build, break and fix again. Working with your hands and your head you’ll craft code that pleases the eye and knocks a zombie into last Tuesday. All the code and directions are provided as both codepen tutorials and downloadable html files, so you can fight the apocalypse how and where you like. You can work with them on the codepen site or on your own device. And later you'll bring those skills together in a final project that cements those skills into zombie smashing muscle memory. Why Zombies? Are zombies just a gimmick? Why would this be any better than a straight laced book that sticks to the facts? Straight laced books are often straight boring. And if you have insomnia problems go buy that book. The author, John, has read the boring books and knows that staying awake and engaged are also important for learning. But this book uses zombie references and analogies not just to make you smile, but to help the material stick. If a tough technical concept is related in silly terms you understand, like a zombie trying to buy gum at a super market, it’s much more likely to stay in that brain those zombies are intent on eating.<br><blockquote>The author, John, has read the boring books and knows that staying awake and engaged are also important for learning.

Empowered with the basics, you will proceed to learn the new features of JavaScript, ES2015, and the latest ES2019. Next, you will apply your learning to build a real application to see how the Web takes shape.At the end, you will also have an introductory section on ReactJS, one of the modern frameworks for UI development and also develop a simple weather application using React. You will be introduced to Redux as the state container for React applications. This book will conclude with an introductory look at additional topics which can be taken up to become a professional and in building enterprise level applications. WHAT WILL YOU LEARN By the end of the book, you will be building real web applications to put your knowledge to practice. This book introduces all the concepts to get started with web application development. To further excel in this field, you really need to practice by building a lot many applications, implementing your own ideas or imitating existing websites. Also remember to practice additional examples provided in the code bundle of the book to master this field. WHO THIS BOOK IS FOR This book can be used by people who are completely new to software development and want to get into front-end web development by starting from basics. This book can also be used by JavaScript users for a quick reference to the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JS, and learn ReactJS with Redux, as well as the new features in JavaScript ES2019.

            "content_html": "An example-driven guide covering modern web app development techniques and emerging technologies such as WebAssembly, Service Workers, and Svelte.js to build faster, secure, and scalable apps Key Features Discover effective techniques for accessing DOM, minimizing painting, and using a V8 engine to optimize JavaScript Understand what makes the web tick and create apps that look and feel like native desktop applications Explore modern JavaScript frameworks like Svelte.js for building next-gen web apps Book Description High-performance web development is all about cutting through the complexities in different layers of a web app and building services and APIs that improve the speed and performance of your apps on the browser. With emerging web technologies, building scalable websites and sustainable web apps is smoother than ever. This book starts by taking you through the web frontend, popular web development practices, and the latest version of ES and JavaScript. You'll work with Node.js and learn how to build web apps without a framework. The book consists of three hands-on examples that help you understand JavaScript applications at both the server-side and the client-side using Node.js and Svelte.js. Each chapter covers modern techniques such as DOM manipulation and V8 engine optimization to strengthen your understanding of the web. Finally, you’ll delve into advanced topics such as CI/CD and how you can harness their capabilities to speed up your web development dramatically. By the end of this web development book, you'll have understood how the JavaScript landscape has evolved, not just for the frontend but also for the backend, and be ready to use new tools and techniques to solve common web problems. What you will learn Explore Vanilla JavaScript for optimizing the DOM, classes, and modules, and querying with jQuery Understand immutable and mutable code and develop faster web apps Delve into Svelte.js and use it to build a complete real-time Todo app Build apps to work offline by caching calls using service workers Write C++ native code and call the WebAssembly module with JavaScript to run it on a browser Implement CircleCI for continuous integration in deploying your web apps Who this book is for This JavaScript book is for web developers, C/C++ programmers, and anyone who wants to build robust web applications using advanced web technologies. This book assumes a good grasp of Vanilla JavaScript and an understanding of web development tools, such as Chrome Developer tools or Mozilla’s developer tools.<br><blockquote>This book assumes a good grasp of Vanilla JavaScript and an understanding of web development tools, such as Chrome Developer tools or Mozilla’s developer tools.</blockquote>",
