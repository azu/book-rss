Then JavaScript may be the language for you. There is a lot of power and efficiency behind this coding language, but because it works with websites and online work, and HTML documents, many programmers are worried about working with it at all. They worry that it will be too hard to learn, won't have enough power to get the work done, or that they will find the tasks too difficult. But nothing could be further from the truth, and we are going to take some time in this guidebook to show you just how easy working with JavaScript can be for you. There are so many things we can learn about when it is time to pull out the JavaScript language, and this guidebook is going to help you go from beginner to advanced in no time at all. Some of the topics we will discuss inside of this guidebook will include: -A history lesson about JavaScript and what it can do for you. -Some of the basics that come with this coding language and how we can write some of our own codes. - A look at the different places on a web page where we can place our HTML code and get it to work well. - A look at statements and declarations -Working with the JavaScript variables. -Some of the basic operators and constructs that work with this language. -How to handle the different mathematical expressions that show up in your code. -How to handle JavaScript objects. -The frustration that can come up with handling dates and times, and some of the basic methods used to fix this issue. -Working with the Document Object Model, or DOM, to get more done. -The importance of classes and prototypes in this language. The JavaScript language is one of the best choices you can make when it is time to take your code and write it for web pages and other HTML documents. Learning how to work with it can really improve your websites, web pages, and other important things you want to do online. When you are ready to get started learning some of the basics, and some of the advanced, parts of the JavaScript coding language, make sure you check out this guidebook today.<br><blockquote>They worry that it will be too hard to learn, won&#39;t have enough power to get the work done, or that they will find the tasks too difficult.</blockquote>",

It can also help create solid backends with platforms like Nodejs, runs desktop applications like Slack, Atom, and Spotify, and runs on mobile phones as Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).In short, it is everywhere-and for good reasons. For starters, compared to other languages like C and Java, JavaScript is generally easier to learn. When we say 'easier', we mean in terms of how quickly you can go from being a JavaScript novice to someone who can actually make a living writing professional, high quality JavaScript code. So, in that sense, it's more accessible than some other languages like C and Java.JavaScript is also a fun and rewarding language, which is especially important when you're just getting started in software development. The community support is very good, so if you get stuck, there's a good chance that the problem and its solution already exist on the web.Now that we've gotten a bird's-eye view of JavaScript, let's get into the more technical detail. JavaScript was created to add 'life to webpages'. Just like HTML and CSS, JavaScript is written in plain text files with a .js extension.As previously mentioned, JavaScript can be used to accomplish many useful operations on the frontend, like validating forms, alerting users, storing temporary data, and performing calculations-to name just a few.Pro tip: Apart from the name itself, JavaScript has no relation to Java.

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is part of the three major elements of modern web pages. The other two are Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. HTML defines the structure of web pages. HTML contains a lot of features and instructs the browser on how to display content. CSS is responsible for styling while JavaScript is a prototype-based language with top-notch functions utilized by web page authors to control element actions. The three major markup languages concepts are explained further in the book. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is an excellent way of designing web pages. With CSS, you determine the color of an element, angle, visibility, size, and position, and more. CSS can be utilized either within the document or as an independent file which must be referenced by the HTML document. CSS is a standard way of styling an individual or group of elements at once. There are many parts and tasks that come with the JavaScript language, and we are going to take some time to explore these a bit more. This will make it easier for us to see how this language works and what we can do with it. From learning how to write our own objects, expressions, operators, and more, this guidebook has all of the tools that you need in order to get started with writing some of our own codes in JavaScript. Working with a coding language can seem hard to work with. This is not always as easy to choose as the others, but the number of features and capabilities that come with this language compared to some of the other options, especially when we are talking about using this on web pages, then JavaScript is the right choice for you. When you are ready to learn more about the JavaScript language and what you are able to do with it, make sure to check out this guidebook to help you get started. JavaScript is capable of acting on or influencing web pages. JavaScript enhances web user interface by confirming actions taken by the user on the client-side. JavaScript contains three data types, which are number, Boolean, and string. With JavaScript, you can describe the functions of your own. In this book, you will learn more about: Fundamental JavaScript Concepts HTML Overview JavaScript's Control Flow Statements The Different Types of Loops in JavaScript Syntax Enabling JavaScript in Browsers Placement of JavaScript in Files Popup Message JavaScript Variables JavaScript ECMAScript Standard Working With JavaScript: A Brief HTML Guide for Beginners Changing the content of HTML elements using DOM Changing CSS using DOM Pointers Expressions and Operators What Are Some Of The JavaScript Variables?

            "content_html": "JavaScript has become the most popular programming language in the world. It has attained that position by being easy to use and powerful in its capabilities. It wasn't always that way but today it can be used to build virtually any application you desire. With the addition of HTML5 and CSS3, it allows for wonderfully animated and powerful web sites and applications without having to use other technologies such as Adobe Flash. JavaScript has also become much more standardized across the multiple browsers in use today. With the recent proliferation of libraries and frameworks that many developers use, the focus has shifted towards these new tools, but they still rely on native JavaScript. And these libraries and frameworks can greatly increase the size of your code as well as slowing down performance. This book covers best practices for coding in straight JavaScript as well as pointing out many areas for optimization. The goal is to help programmers produce smaller and faster JavaScript applications. Even programmers using frameworks and libraries can benefit from understanding the performance trade-offs they make when using those tools.<br><blockquote>This book covers best practices for coding in straight JavaScript as well as pointing out many areas for optimization.
