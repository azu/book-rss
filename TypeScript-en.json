Helps develop maintainable and scalable TypeScript code. DESCRIPTION This book provides a comprehensive guide to TypeScript, a programming language that extends JavaScript with powerful features like static typing, classes, and interfaces. The book is divided into thirteen chapters that cover everything from setting up a development environment to building an Angular app with TypeScript. We start with an introduction to TypeScript and its benefits and go on to explain how TypeScript can help developers write more maintainable, scalable code and catch errors before they make it to production. The book then dives into more technical topics like basic type annotations, using the TypeScript compiler, advanced features like enums and interfaces, and manipulating types. The book then discusses chapters on classes and control flow analysis that are particularly helpful for developers looking to build more complex applications. The book teaches by example, with numerous code examples that illustrate the main concepts and approaches towards writing TypeScript programs and codes, and finishes with a comprehensive practical example that shows step-by-step development of a modern web application using TypeScript and Angular. WHAT WILL YOU LEARN ● Learn how to create a new TypeScript project with default settings and configurations. ● Discover how to incorporate basic type-annotations into your code for improved clarity and accuracy. ● Explore the use of type-aliases, interfaces, and enums to write more organized and expressive TypeScript code. ● Gain knowledge on building modular and error-free applications in TypeScript. ● Discover how to leverage type-guards, classes, and other TypeScript utilities to write more robust code. ● Learn how to work with advanced features like generics and take your TypeScript skills to the next level. WHO IS THIS BOOK FOR? This book is targeted towards front-end developers who are familiar with JavaScript and are interested in expanding their skillset with TypeScript. Whether you are a beginner with little to no experience or an intermediate developer looking for a reference guide, this book is designed to help you supercharge your development and enhance your tooling.

Then, there's ASP.NET Core 5, which is the fastest .NET web framework today. Together, Vue.js for the frontend and ASP.NET Core 5 for the backend make a powerful combination. This book follows a hands-on approach to implementing practical methodologies for building robust applications using ASP.NET Core 5 and Vue.js 3. The topics here are not deep dive and the book is intended for busy .NET developers who have limited time and want a quick implementation of a clean architecture with popular libraries. You’ll start by setting up your web app’s backend, guided by clean architecture, command query responsibility segregation (CQRS), mediator pattern, and Entity Framework Core 5. The book then shows you how to build the frontend application using best practices, state management with Vuex, Vuetify UI component libraries, Vuelidate for input validations, lazy loading with Vue Router, and JWT authentication. Later, you’ll focus on testing and deployment. All the tutorials in this book support Windows 10, macOS, and Linux users. By the end of this book, you’ll be able to build an enterprise full-stack web app, use the most common npm packages for Vue.js and NuGet packages for ASP.NET Core, and deploy Vue.js and ASP.NET Core to Azure App Service using GitHub Actions. What you will learnDiscover CQRS and mediator pattern in the ASP.NET Core 5 Web APIUse Serilog, MediatR, FluentValidation, and Redis in ASP.NETExplore common Vue.js packages such as Vuelidate, Vuetify, and VuexManage complex app states using the Vuex state management libraryWrite integration tests in ASP.NET Core using xUnit and FluentAssertionsDeploy your app to Microsoft Azure using the new GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)Who this book is for This app development book is for .NET developers who want to get started with Vue.js and build full-stack enterprise web applications. Web developers looking to build a proof-of-concept application quickly and pragmatically using their existing knowledge of ASP.NET Core as well as developers who want to write readable and maintainable code using TypeScript and the C# programming language will also find this book useful. The book assumes intermediate-level .NET knowledge along with an understanding of C# programming, JavaScript, and ECMAScript.<br><blockquote>This book follows a hands-on approach to implementing practical methodologies for building robust applications using ASP.NET Core 5 and Vue.js 3.</blockquote>",
