Node.js is a scalable application server that is used in thousands of websites, while GraphQL is becoming the standard way for large websites to provide data and services to their users. Together, these technologies, when reinforced with the capabilities of TypeScript, provide a cutting-edge stack for complete web application development. This book takes a hands-on approach to implementing modern web technologies and the associated methodologies for building full-stack apps. You'll begin by gaining a strong understanding of TypeScript and how to use it to build high-quality web apps. The chapters that follow delve into client-side development with React using the new Hooks API and Redux. Next, you'll get to grips with server-side development with Express, including authentication with Redis-based sessions and accessing databases with TypeORM. The book will then show you how to use Apollo GraphQL to build web services for your full-stack app. Later, you'll learn how to build GraphQL schemas and integrate them with React using Hooks. Finally, you'll focus on how to deploy your application onto an NGINX server using the AWS cloud. By the end of this book, you'll be able to build and deploy complete high-performance web applications using React, Node, and GraphQL. What you will learn Discover TypeScript's most important features and how they can be used to improve code quality and maintainability Understand what React Hooks are and how to build React apps using them Implement state management for your React app using Redux Set up an Express project with TypeScript and GraphQL from scratch Build a fully functional online forum app using React and GraphQL Add authentication to your web app using Redis Save and retrieve data from a Postgres database using TypeORM Configure NGINX on the AWS cloud to deploy and serve your apps Who this book is for The book is for web developers who want to go beyond front-end web development and enter the world of full-stack web development by learning about modern web technologies and how they come together.

Together, they can be used to build full stack apps with enhanced security and scalability at each layer. This book will start by taking you through React and TypeScript components to build an intuitive single-page application. You’ll understand how to design scalable REST APIs that can integrate with a React-based frontend. You’ll get to grips with the latest features, popular patterns, and tools available in the React ecosystem, including function-based components, React Router, and Redux. The book shows how you can use TypeScript along with React to make the frontend robust and maintainable. You’ll then cover important .NET Core features such as API controllers, attribute routing, and model binding to help you build a sturdy backend. Additionally, you’ll explore API security with ASP.NET Core identity and authorization policies, and write reliable unit tests using both .NET Core and React before you deploy your app to the Azure cloud. By the end of the book, you’ll have gained all the knowledge you need to enhance your C# and JavaScript skills and build full stack, production-ready applications with ASP.NET Core and React.
