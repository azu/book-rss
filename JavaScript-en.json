In this book, we learned in this discussion that ES6 support isn't universal yet, but that shouldn't stop you from taking advantage of the benefits of ES6 right now, because you can trans-compile your ES6 to portable ES5. Be sure to include the following things when setting up a new development machine. We also learn how to set up a good editor, git (for installation instructions), Gulp (npm install -g gulp), ESLint (npm install -g eslint). We also learn how to begin a new project (whether it's a scratch project to run the examples in this book or a real project), like a dedicated directory for your project; we call this the project root, a Git repository (git init), a package.json file (npm init), a Gulpfile (gulpfile.js; use the one from this topic), gulp and Babel local packages (npm install --save-dev gulp gulp-babel babel-preset-es2015), a .babelrc file (contents: { \"presets\" [\"es2015\"] }), an .eslintrc file (use eslint --init to create it, and edit to your preferences), a subdirectory for Node source (es6), a subdirectory for browser source (public/es6). Your also simple workflow will look like this once you've set it up by making improvements that are logically consistent and connected also to test and lint your code, use Gulp with rep until the improvements are successful and lint-free. Alao makes sure you're not going to do something you don't want to do (git status). Connect any files to yours.gitignore file that you don't want in Git. In the last Add all of your changes to Git (git add -A; if you don't want to add all of your changes, just use git add for each file).

            "summary": "Beginner to Expert in Web development with JavaScript: From HTML to React-Redux KEY FEATURES - Acquire web development skills to build independent applications - Understand the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Redux - Create build beautiful applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Redux - Learn how to debug and unit test your applications properly to build good end products - Follow best practices to write good quality code and build performant applications DESCRIPTION This book will take you on a complete journey of learning web development, starting right with the basics. The book begins with the history of web development and JavaScript, how it has evolved over these years, and how it still keeps growing with new features. Next, you will learn the basic pillars of web development - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will learn about the functional, object-oriented programming and asynchronous behaviour, and how JavaScript provides for these. Empowered with the basics, you will proceed to learn the new features of JavaScript, ES2015, and the latest ES2019. Next, you will apply your learning to build a real application to see how the Web takes shape.At the end, you will also have an introductory section on ReactJS, one of the modern frameworks for UI development and also develop a simple weather application using React. You will be introduced to Redux as the state container for React applications. This book will conclude with an introductory look at additional topics which can be taken up to become a professional and in building enterprise level applications. WHAT WILL YOU LEARN By the end of the book, you will be building real web applications to put your knowledge to practice. This book introduces all the concepts to get started with web application development. To further excel in this field, you really need to practice by building a lot many applications, implementing your own ideas or imitating existing websites. Also remember to practice additional examples provided in the code bundle of the book to master this field. WHO THIS BOOK IS FOR This book can be used by people who are completely new to software development and want to get into front-end web development by starting from basics. This book can also be used by JavaScript users for a quick reference to the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JS, and learn ReactJS with Redux, as well as the new features in JavaScript ES2019.

With emerging web technologies, building scalable websites and sustainable web apps is smoother than ever. This book starts by taking you through the web frontend, popular web development practices, and the latest version of ES and JavaScript. You'll work with Node.js and learn how to build web apps without a framework. The book consists of three hands-on examples that help you understand JavaScript applications at both the server-side and the client-side using Node.js and Svelte.js. Each chapter covers modern techniques such as DOM manipulation and V8 engine optimization to strengthen your understanding of the web. Finally, you’ll delve into advanced topics such as CI/CD and how you can harness their capabilities to speed up your web development dramatically. By the end of this web development book, you'll have understood how the JavaScript landscape has evolved, not just for the frontend but also for the backend, and be ready to use new tools and techniques to solve common web problems. What you will learn Explore Vanilla JavaScript for optimizing the DOM, classes, and modules, and querying with jQuery Understand immutable and mutable code and develop faster web apps Delve into Svelte.js and use it to build a complete real-time Todo app Build apps to work offline by caching calls using service workers Write C++ native code and call the WebAssembly module with JavaScript to run it on a browser Implement CircleCI for continuous integration in deploying your web apps Who this book is for This JavaScript book is for web developers, C/C++ programmers, and anyone who wants to build robust web applications using advanced web technologies. This book assumes a good grasp of Vanilla JavaScript and an understanding of web development tools, such as Chrome Developer tools or Mozilla’s developer tools.<br><blockquote>This book assumes a good grasp of Vanilla JavaScript and an understanding of web development tools, such as Chrome Developer tools or Mozilla’s developer tools.</blockquote>",
