This volume follows Auden as a mature artist, containing all the poems that he published or submitted for publication from 1940 until his death in 1973, at age sixty-six. This includes all his poetry collections from this period, from The Double Man (1941) through Epistle to a Godson (1972). The volume also features an edited version of his incomplete, posthumous book Thank You, Fog, as well as his self-designated “posthumous” poems. The main text presents the poems in their original published versions.

Then, there's ASP.NET Core 5, which is the fastest .NET web framework today. Together, Vue.js for the frontend and ASP.NET Core 5 for the backend make a powerful combination. This book follows a hands-on approach to implementing practical methodologies for building robust applications using ASP.NET Core 5 and Vue.js 3. The topics here are not deep dive and the book is intended for busy .NET developers who have limited time and want a quick implementation of a clean architecture with popular libraries. You’ll start by setting up your web app’s backend, guided by clean architecture, command query responsibility segregation (CQRS), mediator pattern, and Entity Framework Core 5. The book then shows you how to build the frontend application using best practices, state management with Vuex, Vuetify UI component libraries, Vuelidate for input validations, lazy loading with Vue Router, and JWT authentication. Later, you’ll focus on testing and deployment. All the tutorials in this book support Windows 10, macOS, and Linux users. By the end of this book, you’ll be able to build an enterprise full-stack web app, use the most common npm packages for Vue.js and NuGet packages for ASP.NET Core, and deploy Vue.js and ASP.NET Core to Azure App Service using GitHub Actions. What you will learnDiscover CQRS and mediator pattern in the ASP.NET Core 5 Web APIUse Serilog, MediatR, FluentValidation, and Redis in ASP.NETExplore common Vue.js packages such as Vuelidate, Vuetify, and VuexManage complex app states using the Vuex state management libraryWrite integration tests in ASP.NET Core using xUnit and FluentAssertionsDeploy your app to Microsoft Azure using the new GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)Who this book is for This app development book is for .NET developers who want to get started with Vue.js and build full-stack enterprise web applications. Web developers looking to build a proof-of-concept application quickly and pragmatically using their existing knowledge of ASP.NET Core as well as developers who want to write readable and maintainable code using TypeScript and the C# programming language will also find this book useful. The book assumes intermediate-level .NET knowledge along with an understanding of C# programming, JavaScript, and ECMAScript.<br><blockquote>This book follows a hands-on approach to implementing practical methodologies for building robust applications using ASP.NET Core 5 and Vue.js 3.</blockquote>",
