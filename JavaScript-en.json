In this book, we learned in this discussion that ES6 support isn't universal yet, but that shouldn't stop you from taking advantage of the benefits of ES6 right now, because you can trans-compile your ES6 to portable ES5. Be sure to include the following things when setting up a new development machine. We also learn how to set up a good editor, git (for installation instructions), Gulp (npm install -g gulp), ESLint (npm install -g eslint). We also learn how to begin a new project (whether it's a scratch project to run the examples in this book or a real project), like a dedicated directory for your project; we call this the project root, a Git repository (git init), a package.json file (npm init), a Gulpfile (gulpfile.js; use the one from this topic), gulp and Babel local packages (npm install --save-dev gulp gulp-babel babel-preset-es2015), a .babelrc file (contents: { \"presets\" [\"es2015\"] }), an .eslintrc file (use eslint --init to create it, and edit to your preferences), a subdirectory for Node source (es6), a subdirectory for browser source (public/es6). Your also simple workflow will look like this once you've set it up by making improvements that are logically consistent and connected also to test and lint your code, use Gulp with rep until the improvements are successful and lint-free. Alao makes sure you're not going to do something you don't want to do (git status). Connect any files to yours.gitignore file that you don't want in Git.

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is part of the three major elements of modern web pages. The other two are Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. HTML defines the structure of web pages. HTML contains a lot of features and instructs the browser on how to display content. CSS is responsible for styling while JavaScript is a prototype-based language with top-notch functions utilized by web page authors to control element actions. The three major markup languages concepts are explained further in the book. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is an excellent way of designing web pages. With CSS, you determine the color of an element, angle, visibility, size, and position, and more. CSS can be utilized either within the document or as an independent file which must be referenced by the HTML document. CSS is a standard way of styling an individual or group of elements at once. There are many parts and tasks that come with the JavaScript language, and we are going to take some time to explore these a bit more. This will make it easier for us to see how this language works and what we can do with it. From learning how to write our own objects, expressions, operators, and more, this guidebook has all of the tools that you need in order to get started with writing some of our own codes in JavaScript. Working with a coding language can seem hard to work with. This is not always as easy to choose as the others, but the number of features and capabilities that come with this language compared to some of the other options, especially when we are talking about using this on web pages, then JavaScript is the right choice for you. When you are ready to learn more about the JavaScript language and what you are able to do with it, make sure to check out this guidebook to help you get started. JavaScript is capable of acting on or influencing web pages. JavaScript enhances web user interface by confirming actions taken by the user on the client-side. JavaScript contains three data types, which are number, Boolean, and string. With JavaScript, you can describe the functions of your own. In this book, you will learn more about: Fundamental JavaScript Concepts HTML Overview JavaScript's Control Flow Statements The Different Types of Loops in JavaScript Syntax Enabling JavaScript in Browsers Placement of JavaScript in Files Popup Message JavaScript Variables JavaScript ECMAScript Standard Working With JavaScript: A Brief HTML Guide for Beginners Changing the content of HTML elements using DOM Changing CSS using DOM Pointers Expressions and Operators What Are Some Of The JavaScript Variables?

It is the foundation of frontend web development and is the key ingredient in frameworks like ReactJS, Angular, and VueJS. It can also help create solid backends with platforms like Nodejs, runs desktop applications like Slack, Atom, and Spotify, and runs on mobile phones as Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).In short, it is everywhere-and for good reasons. For starters, compared to other languages like C and Java, JavaScript is generally easier to learn. When we say 'easier', we mean in terms of how quickly you can go from being a JavaScript novice to someone who can actually make a living writing professional, high quality JavaScript code. So, in that sense, it's more accessible than some other languages like C and Java.JavaScript is also a fun and rewarding language, which is especially important when you're just getting started in software development. The community support is very good, so if you get stuck, there's a good chance that the problem and its solution already exist on the web.Now that we've gotten a bird's-eye view of JavaScript, let's get into the more technical detail. JavaScript was created to add 'life to webpages'. Just like HTML and CSS, JavaScript is written in plain text files with a .js extension.As previously mentioned, JavaScript can be used to accomplish many useful operations on the frontend, like validating forms, alerting users, storing temporary data, and performing calculations-to name just a few.Pro tip: Apart from the name itself, JavaScript has no relation to Java. Beginners often get confused between the two languages.

            "content_html": "Completely revised and updated, this best-selling introduction to programming in JavaScript focuses on writing real applications. JavaScript lies at the heart of almost every modern web application, from social apps like Twitter to browser-based game frameworks like Phaser and Babylon. Though simple for beginners to pick up and play with, JavaScript is a flexible, complex language that you can use to build full-scale applications. This much anticipated and thoroughly revised third edition of Eloquent JavaScript dives deep into the JavaScript language to show you how to write beautiful, effective code. It has been updated to reflect the current state of Java¬Script and web browsers and includes brand-new material on features like class notation, arrow functions, iterators, async functions, template strings, and block scope. A host of new exercises have also been added to test your skills and keep you on track. As with previous editions, Haverbeke continues to teach through extensive examples and immerses you in code from the start, while exercises and full-chapter projects give you hands-on experience with writing your own programs. You start by learning the basic structure of the JavaScript language as well as control structures, functions, and data structures to help you write basic programs. Then you'll learn about error handling and bug fixing, modularity, and asynchronous programming before moving on to web browsers and how JavaScript is used to program them. As you build projects such as an artificial life simulation, a simple programming language, and a paint program, you'll learn how to: - Understand the essential elements of programming, including syntax, control, and data - Organize and clarify your code with object-oriented and functional programming techniques - Script the browser and make basic web applications - Use the DOM effectively to interact with browsers - Harness Node.js to build servers and utilities Isn't it time you became fluent in the language of the Web? * All source code is available online in an inter¬active sandbox, where you can edit the code, run it, and see its output instantly.<br><blockquote>As with previous editions, Haverbeke continues to teach through extensive examples and immerses you in code from the start, while exercises and full-chapter projects give you hands-on experience with writing your own programs.</blockquote>",
