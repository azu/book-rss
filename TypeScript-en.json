This book highlights how Typescript works with JavaScript and its frameworks, giving it greater functionality, especially for larger enterprise projects. You'll start by reviewing some fundamentals such as how to run a TypeScript file and compile it to JavaScript as well as understand how it sits within the full ecosystem alongside React, Redux, Angular and Webpack. Using a practical project-led approach, you'll go through key concepts and aspects of Typescript such as compilers, arrays, classes and interfaces. Once you complete the fundamental basics, you'll move onto more complex topics like advanced types. You'll also learn about Decorators, which are a must-have feature in Angular. The book then presents a small To-do list project followed by a larger 'Drag and Drop' project. You'll see how to divide the drag and drop project into small manageable modules and learn to make the project more efficient with Webpack. Lastly, you'll create two more React projects, a party app with React and then one with React and Redux. Typescript Basics reveals how this JavaScript extension is currently the fastest growing language for web development with more and more developers and companies looking to utilize and adopt it within their current workflows and projects. What You'll Learn Understand the particulars of Typescript and how it feeds into the JS and Web development eco-system Implement Typescript for enterprise projects Use Typescript with practical projects and examples See how Typescript interacts with major frameworks like React and Angular Who This Book Is For Those who want to learn about TypeScript and implement it in their Enterprise or hobby projects with React and Angular.

In this edition, you'll learn about all the features of Three.js and understand how to integrate it with the newest physics engines. You'll also develop a strong grip on creating and animating immersive 3D scenes directly in your browser, reaping the full potential of WebGL and modern browsers. The book starts with the basic concepts and building blocks used in Three.js and helps you explore these essential topics in detail through extensive examples and code samples. You'll learn how to create realistic-looking 3D objects using textures and materials and how to load existing models from an external source. Next, you'll understand how to control the camera using the Three.js built-in camera controls, which will enable you to fly or walk around the 3D scene you've created. Later chapters will cover the use of HTML5 video and canvas elements as materials for your 3D objects to animate your models. You'll learn how to use morph targets and skeleton-based animation, before understanding how to add physics, such as gravity and collision detection, to your scene. Finally, you'll master combining Blender with Three.js and creating VR and AR scenes. By the end of this book, you'll be well-equipped to create 3D-animated graphics using Three.js. What You Will Learn: Implement the different camera controls provided by Three.js to navigate your 3D scene Discover working with vertices directly to create snow, rain, and galaxy-like effects Import and animate models from external formats, such as glTF, OBJ, STL, and COLLADA Design and run animations using morph targets and bone-based animation Create realistic-looking 3D objects using advanced textures on materials Interact directly with WebGL by creating custom vertex and fragment shaders Make scenes using the Rapier physics engine, and integrate Three.js with VR and AR Who this book is for: This book is for JavaScript developers looking to learn the use of Three.js library.<br><blockquote>Finally, you&#39;ll master combining Blender with Three.js and creating VR and AR scenes.
