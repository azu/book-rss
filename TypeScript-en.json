Whether you’ve been in the developer kitchen for decades or are just taking the plunge to do it yourself, The Complete Developer will show you how to build and implement every component of a modern stack—from scratch. You’ll go from a React-driven frontend to a fully fleshed-out backend with Mongoose, MongoDB, and a complete set of REST and GraphQL APIs, and back again through the whole Next.js stack. The book’s easy-to-follow, step-by-step recipes will teach you how to build a web server with Express.js, create custom API routes, deploy applications via self-contained microservices, and add a reactive, component-based UI. You’ll leverage command line tools and full-stack frameworks to build an application whose no-effort user management rides on GitHub logins. You’ll also learn how to: Work with modern JavaScript syntax, TypeScript, and the Next.js framework Simplify UI development with the React library Extend your application with REST and GraphQL APIs Manage your data with the MongoDB NoSQL database Use OAuth to simplify user management, authentication, and authorization Automate testing with Jest, test-driven development, stubs, mocks, and fakes Whether you’re an experienced software engineer or new to DIY web development, The Complete Developer will teach you to succeed with the modern full stack. After all, control matters.

Helps develop maintainable and scalable TypeScript code. DESCRIPTION This book provides a comprehensive guide to TypeScript, a programming language that extends JavaScript with powerful features like static typing, classes, and interfaces. The book is divided into thirteen chapters that cover everything from setting up a development environment to building an Angular app with TypeScript. We start with an introduction to TypeScript and its benefits and go on to explain how TypeScript can help developers write more maintainable, scalable code and catch errors before they make it to production. The book then dives into more technical topics like basic type annotations, using the TypeScript compiler, advanced features like enums and interfaces, and manipulating types. The book then discusses chapters on classes and control flow analysis that are particularly helpful for developers looking to build more complex applications. The book teaches by example, with numerous code examples that illustrate the main concepts and approaches towards writing TypeScript programs and codes, and finishes with a comprehensive practical example that shows step-by-step development of a modern web application using TypeScript and Angular. WHAT WILL YOU LEARN ● Learn how to create a new TypeScript project with default settings and configurations. ● Discover how to incorporate basic type-annotations into your code for improved clarity and accuracy. ● Explore the use of type-aliases, interfaces, and enums to write more organized and expressive TypeScript code. ● Gain knowledge on building modular and error-free applications in TypeScript. ● Discover how to leverage type-guards, classes, and other TypeScript utilities to write more robust code. ● Learn how to work with advanced features like generics and take your TypeScript skills to the next level. WHO IS THIS BOOK FOR? This book is targeted towards front-end developers who are familiar with JavaScript and are interested in expanding their skillset with TypeScript. Whether you are a beginner with little to no experience or an intermediate developer looking for a reference guide, this book is designed to help you supercharge your development and enhance your tooling. With its clear and concise explanations, it's perfect for those who are new to TypeScript and looking to gain a deeper understanding of its capabilities.
