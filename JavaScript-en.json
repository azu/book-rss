TypeScript combines the typing features of C# or Java with the flexibility of JavaScript, reducing typing errors and providing an easier path to JavaScript development. Author Adam Freeman explains how to get the most from TypeScript 4 in this second edition of his best-selling book. He begins by describing the TypeScript language and the benefits it offers and then shows you how to use TypeScript in real-world scenarios, including development with the DOM API, and popular frameworks such as Angular and React. He starts from the nuts-and-bolts and builds up to the most advanced and sophisticated features. Each topic is covered clearly and concisely, and is packed with the details you need to be effective. The most important features are given a no-nonsense, in-depth treatment and chapters include common problems and teach you how to avoid them.

JAVASCRIPT (Book no. 2) Our program's control flow is what keeps it running. Although variables and constants hold all of the interesting data, control flow statements allow us to use the data to make useful decisions. Flowcharts are a fantastic way to visualize control flow, and explaining a problem with a high-level flowchart before digging into the code is often simpler. Code is a more efficient and (with practice) natural way of communicating control flow than flowcharts (many attempts have been made to construct programming languages that were visual only, yet text-based languages have never been threatened by this usurper). Like most modern languages, JavaScript has a large and useful collection of operators that can be used to manipulate data. Some, like the bitwise operators, are only likely to be used once in a while. Others, such as member access managers, aren't always considered operators (though they can be useful when trying to solve a difficult operator precedence problem). Assignment, arithmetic, comparison, and Boolean are the most common operators, and you'll be using them often, so make sure you understand them before going on. JavaScript relies heavily on functions. They are capable of constructing extremely efficient algorithmic units in addition to simply modularizing code. The mechanics of functions have been the focus of this chapter, which is a dry but necessary introduction. We'll see the power of functions unleashed in the following chapters once we've established this base. Since the value is copied as primitives are passed around in JavaScript, they are referred to as value forms in computer science. Objects are referred to as reference types since all variables refer to the same object as they are passed around (that is, they both hold a reference to the same object). Similar features can be done in ES5 using arguments, a special variable that only exists within function bodies. This variable was not an array, but rather a \"array-like\" object that needed special handling or conversion to a true array.

JAVASCRIPT In this book, we learned in this discussion that ES6 support isn't universal yet, but that shouldn't stop you from taking advantage of the benefits of ES6 right now, because you can trans-compile your ES6 to portable ES5. Be sure to include the following things when setting up a new development machine. We also learn how to set up a good editor, git (for installation instructions), Gulp (npm install -g gulp), ESLint (npm install -g eslint). We also learn how to begin a new project (whether it's a scratch project to run the examples in this book or a real project), like a dedicated directory for your project; we call this the project root, a Git repository (git init), a package.json file (npm init), a Gulpfile (gulpfile.js; use the one from this topic), gulp and Babel local packages (npm install --save-dev gulp gulp-babel babel-preset-es2015), a .babelrc file (contents: { \"presets\" [\"es2015\"] }), an .eslintrc file (use eslint --init to create it, and edit to your preferences), a subdirectory for Node source (es6), a subdirectory for browser source (public/es6). Your also simple workflow will look like this once you've set it up by making improvements that are logically consistent and connected also to test and lint your code, use Gulp with rep until the improvements are successful and lint-free.

This book is written in a practical and easy way and offers theory and plenty of practical material. There are explanations and practical examples that help beginners learn fast. Instead of diving deeper into lengthy and boring texts, I tried to get straight to the point for each topic. I have defined each topic and added an easy to understand explanation to help you understand the concepts and the main keywords that will do the magic in the code. Coupled with the explanation, you will find a code snippet for each topic that is custom written and has been tested for errors. You can copy them and load them up on a web browser to see the results, or you can simply edit them and customize them to understand them well. The choice is yours. First book is written in an orderly form with beginner-level topics and progressively tougher topics later on. Second book is focusing on React JS, this guide is aimed at those who already have a programming background and some experience in programming for the web but need to brush up on their skills and learn new ones. Third book will take you through the important concepts involved in using Node.js to build your server-side applications. Each chapter is self-contained with its own practical but simple examples to show you how it works.
