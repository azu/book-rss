You’ll master Svelte’s unique state management model, use Sapper for simplified page routing, and take on modern best practices like code splitting, offline support, and server-rendered views. Summary Imagine web apps with fast browser load times that also offer amazing developer productivity and require less code to create. That’s what Svelte and Sapper deliver! Svelte pushes a lot of the work a frontend framework would handle to the compile step, so your app components come out as tight, well-organized JavaScript modules. Sapper is a lightweight web framework that minimizes application size through server-rendering front pages and only loading the JavaScript you need. The end result is more efficient apps with great UX and simplified state management. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the technology Many web frameworks load hundreds of “just-in-case” code lines that clutter and slow your apps. Svelte, an innovative, developer-friendly tool, instead compiles applications to very small bundles for lightning-fast load times that do more with less code.

Learn how to use JavaScript Visually uses a creative, visual approach to help beginners understand simple concepts. It's a short book, so it's a good weekend read for somebody who's just starting up with JavaScript. Picking up a 1,000-page book with nothing but boring text inside is more miserable, frustrating, and discouraging for a new coder. Not only is the presentation appealing, but it is also organized well. It layers logically and adequately progresses to the advanced concepts. It isn't a JavaScript book in the traditional sense. It's an introduction to programming that uses JavaScript, as the title suggests. It's excellent for this reason. A student who does not understand how to write a JavaScript program is widespread.
