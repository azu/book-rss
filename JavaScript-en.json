A front-end web application can be provided by any web server, but it is executed on the user's computer device (smartphone, tablet or notebook), and not on the remote web server. Typically, but not necessarily, a front-end web application is a single-user application, which is not shared with other users. Content: I. Associations 20. Reference Properties and Unidirectional Associations 21. Implementing Unidirectional Functional Associations 22. Implementing Unidirectional Non-Functional Associations 23. Practice Projects 24. Bidirectional Associations 25. Implementing Bidirectional Associations 26. Part-Whole Associations 27. Lessons Learned 28. Practice Projects II. Inheritance in Class Hierarchies 29. Subtyping and Inheritance 30. Implementing Class Hierarchies in a Plain JavaScript Front-End App 31. Implementing Class Hierarchies in a Java EE Back-End App 32. Practice Projects III. Model-Based App Development<br><blockquote>The book provides an in-depth tutorial for theory-underpinned and example-based learning by doing it yourself, supported by quiz questions and practice projects.</blockquote>",

The first two units cover the fundamental concepts of JavaScript such as variables, operators, control structures, arrays, functions and strings. In the third unit, the concept of form and event handling is discussed. This feature of JavaScript help us to design the interactive web page with graphical user interface. In the next subsequent chapter, the book demonstrates how to create and manage cookies, how to create browser history, implementation of form validation with the help of regular expressions, creating rollover effects and creating and handling frames. At the end, the book illustrates creation of banner, management of status bar and creation of slideshows using JavaScript.
