Testing JavaScript Applications is a guide to building a comprehensive and reliable JS application testing suite, covering both how to write tests and how JS testing tools work under the hood. Automated testing will help you write high-quality software in less time, with more confidence, fewer bugs, and without constant manual oversight. Testing JavaScript Applications is a guide to building a comprehensive and reliable JS application testing suite, covering both how to write tests and how JS testing tools work under the hood. Testing JavaScript Applications teaches you how to create JavaScript tests that are targeted to your application's specific needs. Through dozens of detailed code samples that you can apply to your own projects, you'll learn how to write tests for both backend and frontend applications, covering the full spectrum of testing types. Taking on the role of a developer for a bakery's web store, you'll learn to validate different aspects including databases, third-party services, and how to spin-up a real browser instance to interact with the entire application. All examples are delivered using the popular testing tool Jest and modern packages of the JavaScript ecosystem.

For the last couple of years, the news keeps talking about the digital economy and how everyone needs programmers. It seems like everyone wants to learn how to code. However, it is not that easy. Coding is a skill; and like any skill it takes time to learn. Like any skill, the younger you start; the better you get. From my personal experience with coding and also with teaching young kids how to code, let me tell you that coding is a lot of fun and extremely gratifying. It teaches you how to organize, think logically, communicate, work in teams and be more creative. However, programming can be hard to learn. Especially if you start reading advanced books. You need a step-by-step guide to get started. This book starts off with the very basics; how to install the software, set up and write your first lines of code. There are exercises at the end of each chapter that can test your new found knowledge and move you ahead. And then, we get you a few more advanced skills that can get you started making websites.

Join Matthew MacDonald, author of too-many-tech-books-to-count, as he enters the world of JavaScript-accompanied by friendly ninjas, cheating goblins, and at least one rude wizard. Develop your skills with 35 interactive exercises on CodePen. Best of all, there's no setup required (a web browser is all you need). Who needs another book about coding for kids? These days, you can't turn around twice without someone trying to teach you how to code. So why the heck did I write my own book? When my daughters started learning to code, I discovered that most tutorials were as dry as dust. If you wanted something more fun, you could play a coding game and write commands to move a character around a maze. But unlike real programming, there was no chance to be creative. There was no freedom. There was no invitation to build your own programs. Here's what makes this book different: Hands-on practice. If you want to learn a new skill, you need to practice. Otherwise, it's just a bunch of theory swimming around in your head. Friendly for beginners. If you're a beginner, it's not enough to learn the basics of a programming language like JavaScript. You also need to learn the concepts of programming at the same time. No setup required. The world is full of amazing frameworks, tools, and code editors. But who wants to install a bunch of software before you even get started? Tiny. I'm a programming nerd, so I like talking about things like Big O notation. But no one needs to be buried in theory at the start of their journey. In this book, every chapter is a bite-sized lesson that you can usually finish in one sitting. Kinda fun. Not everyone has the motivation to learn from an old-fashioned textbook. But who doesn't want to play dice with a cheating goblin? So I decided to make something of my own. Then I unleashed it on my family. This is the result of those experiments. Why JavaScript? JavaScript is a great first language for people learning to code. It's not because JavaScript is a great teaching language (it mostly isn't). It's because JavaScript is everywhere-on every operating system, every browser, and almost every electronic device that's more complicated than a toaster. That means you can effortlessly share your JavaScript programs with friends. Unlike all the rest of computing history, there's no downloading, installing, or configuring. And it doesn't hurt that JavaScript syntax is similar to many other professional languages, like Java and C#. That means the effort you spend to learn JavaScript is never wasted. Can adults read this book? Most certainly! However, this book assumes you're learning JavaScript and programming for the first time. If you already know a bit about programming, you'll probably prefer a guide that focuses on the JavaScript language without re-introducing the concepts you already know.<br><blockquote>Can adults read this book?

Otherwise, it's just a bunch of theory swimming around in your head. Friendly for beginners. If you're a beginner, it's not enough to learn the basics of a programming language like JavaScript. You also need to learn the concepts of programming at the same time. No setup required. The world is full of amazing frameworks, tools, and code editors. But who wants to install a bunch of software before you even get started? Tiny. I'm a programming nerd, so I like talking about things like Big O notation. But no one needs to be buried in theory at the start of their journey. In this book, every chapter is a bite-sized lesson that you can usually finish in one sitting. Kinda fun. Not everyone has the motivation to learn from an old-fashioned textbook. But who doesn't want to play dice with a cheating goblin? So I decided to make something of my own. Then I unleashed it on my family. This is the result of those experiments. Why JavaScript? JavaScript is a great first language for people learning to code. It's not because JavaScript is a great teaching language (it mostly isn't). It's because JavaScript is everywhere-on every operating system, every browser, and almost every electronic device that's more complicated than a toaster. That means you can effortlessly share your JavaScript programs with friends. Unlike all the rest of computing history, there's no downloading, installing, or configuring. And it doesn't hurt that JavaScript syntax is similar to many other professional languages, like Java and C#. That means the effort you spend to learn JavaScript is never wasted. Can adults read this book? Most certainly! However, this book assumes you're learning JavaScript and programming for the first time. If you already know a bit about programming, you'll probably prefer a guide that focuses on the JavaScript language without re-introducing the concepts you already know.",
