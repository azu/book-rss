React Native is an open-source JavaScript framework that allows you to create applications for many platforms, including iOS, Android, and the web, all with the same code base. It is built on the React framework, and it provides all of React’s power to mobile app development. React Native was a natural continuation of React. It is a mobile framework that includes JavaScript to create near-native apps. JSX, a hybrid of JavaScript and XML-like markup, is used to make React Native applications. The React Native “bridge” then calls the native rendering APIs in Objective-C (for iOS) or Java (for Android) behind the scenes (for Android). As a result, your app will appear and feel like any other mobile app, as it will be rendered using genuine mobile UI components instead of web views. React Native also offers JavaScript interfaces for platform APIs, allowing your React Native apps to use features such as user location and the phone camera. If your app is UI focused, React Native is an excellent choice because it comes with an extensive UI library. Becoming a React Native developer gives you access to exciting, cutting-edge projects which frequently incorporate innovative technology like Augmented Reality. Job opportunities for React Native devs are aplenty, and it is undoubtedly a skill worthy of consideration owing to its popularity with startups and corporates alike. With Mastering React Native, learning React Native becomes easy and will help readers undoubtedly advance their careers.
