Using the same language that powers web browsers and Node.js, the Moddable SDK empowers IoT developers to apply many of the same tools and techniques used to build sophisticated websites and mobile apps. The Moddable SDK enables you to unlock the full potential of inexpensive microcontrollers like the ESP32 and ESP8266. Coding for these microcontrollers in C or C++ with the ESP-IDF and Arduino SDKs works for building basic products but doesn't scale to handle the increasingly complex IoT products that customers expect. The Moddable SDK adds the lightweight XS JavaScript engine to those traditional environments, accelerating development with JavaScript while keeping the performance benefits of a native SDK. Building user interfaces and communicating over the network are two areas where JavaScript really shines. IoT Development for ESP32 and ESP8266 with JavaScript shows you how to build responsive touch screen user interfaces using the Piu framework. You'll learn how easy it is to securely send and receive JSON data over Wi-Fi with elegant JavaScript APIs for common IoT protocols, including HTTP/HTTPS, WebSocket, MQTT, and mDNS. You'll also learn how to integrate common sensors and actuators, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), file systems, and more into your projects, and you'll see firsthand how JavaScript makes it easier to combine these diverse technologies.
