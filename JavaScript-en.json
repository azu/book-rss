In this book, we learned in this discussion that ES6 support isn't universal yet, but that shouldn't stop you from taking advantage of the benefits of ES6 right now, because you can trans-compile your ES6 to portable ES5. Be sure to include the following things when setting up a new development machine. We also learn how to set up a good editor, git (for installation instructions), Gulp (npm install -g gulp), ESLint (npm install -g eslint). We also learn how to begin a new project (whether it's a scratch project to run the examples in this book or a real project), like a dedicated directory for your project; we call this the project root, a Git repository (git init), a package.json file (npm init), a Gulpfile (gulpfile.js; use the one from this topic), gulp and Babel local packages (npm install --save-dev gulp gulp-babel babel-preset-es2015), a .babelrc file (contents: { \"presets\" [\"es2015\"] }), an .eslintrc file (use eslint --init to create it, and edit to your preferences), a subdirectory for Node source (es6), a subdirectory for browser source (public/es6). Your also simple workflow will look like this once you've set it up by making improvements that are logically consistent and connected also to test and lint your code, use Gulp with rep until the improvements are successful and lint-free. Alao makes sure you're not going to do something you don't want to do (git status). Connect any files to yours.gitignore file that you don't want in Git.

In this series of books we will overcome the problem of having to write code for Android and iOS by using React Native. React Native is a framework developed by Facebook for creating native-style apps for iOS & Android under one common language, JavaScript. Initially, Facebook only developed React Native to support iOS. However with its recent support of the Android operating system, the library can now render mobile UIs for both platforms. Why React Native ? Not only react native allows you to create cross platform applications but react native also makes updating apps simple through over-the-app updates. Over the air update in react native is achieved through technologies such as CodePush with a few lines of code. Armed with React Native you’ll finally be able to make apps of your choice in no time and I’m glad to show you what React Native can do through this series of books.
