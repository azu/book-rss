This web application development book provides you with all the Django tools you need to simplify your developments with real-time results. You'll learn state-of-the-art WebSocket techniques to realize real-time applications with minimal reliance on JavaScript. This book will also show you how to create a project with Docker from the ground up, test it, and deploy it on a server. You'll learn how to create a project, add Docker, and discover development libraries, Django channels, and bidirectional communication, and from then, on you'll create real projects of all kinds using HTML over WebSockets as a chat app or a blog with real-time comments. In addition, you'll modernize your development techniques by moving from using an SSR model to creating web pages using WebSockets over HTML. With Django, you'll be able to create SPAs with professional real-time projects where the logic is in Python. By the end of this Django book, you'll be able to build real-time applications, as well as gaining a solid understanding of WebSockets with Django. What You Will Learn: Explore real-time site realization Understand the proper use of Django channels Find out how to set up Docker with Django Discover how to use a JavaScript framework such as Stimulus Manage a database asynchronously in Django Bring dynamic rendering logic to the backend Who this book is for: This book is for developers looking to build applications where they want to bring logic to the backend, learn WebSockets, and not depend on JavaScript heavily to create a single-page application.

Quite frankly, JavaScript is vital in web development. Furthermore, due to the increasing user bases of current development frameworks, its popularity has grown. If you're new to JavaScript and don't need a detailed guide, this book is worth looking at. Learn how to use JavaScript Visually uses a creative, visual approach to help beginners understand simple concepts. It's a short book, so it's a good weekend read for somebody who's just starting up with JavaScript. Picking up a 1,000-page book with nothing but boring text inside is more miserable, frustrating, and discouraging for a new coder. Not only is the presentation appealing, but it is also organized well. It layers logically and adequately progresses to the advanced concepts. It isn't a JavaScript book in the traditional sense. It's an introduction to programming that uses JavaScript, as the title suggests. It's excellent for this reason. A student who does not understand how to write a JavaScript program is widespread. It's common to come across a developer who can code JavaScript but has no background in computer science. Java Script Programming will help develop a strong computer science base (its prime purpose). Here's what you're going to discover in the pages of JAVASCRIPT PROGRAMMING: Basics of Javascript Working of Javascript Basic rules and practical applications Make your Javascript program Mistakes to avoid with Javascript ...and more!

The book is extremely user-friendly. It assumes no programming experience and helps the students to learn the JavaScript in step by step manner with the help of illustrative examples. The first two units cover the fundamental concepts of JavaScript such as variables, operators, control structures, arrays, functions and strings. In the third unit, the concept of form and event handling is discussed. This feature of JavaScript help us to design the interactive web page with graphical user interface. In the next subsequent chapter, the book demonstrates how to create and manage cookies, how to create browser history, implementation of form validation with the help of regular expressions, creating rollover effects and creating and handling frames. At the end, the book illustrates creation of banner, management of status bar and creation of slideshows using JavaScript.
