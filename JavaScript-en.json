The only technical requirement for using Blazor WebAssembly is a browser that supports WebAssembly, which, as of today, all modern browsers do. Blazor WebAssembly by Example is a project-based guide for learning how to build single-page web applications using the Blazor WebAssembly framework. This book emphasizes the practical over the theoretical by providing detailed step-by-step instructions for each project. You'll start by building simple standalone web applications and progress to developing more advanced hosted web applications with SQL Server backends. Each project covers a different aspect of the Blazor WebAssembly ecosystem, such as Razor components, JavaScript interop, event handling, application state, and dependency injection. The book is designed in such a way that you can complete the projects in any order. By the end of this book, you will have experience building a wide variety of single-page web applications with .NET, Blazor WebAssembly, and C#. What you will learn Discover the power of the C# language for both server-side and client-side web development Use the Blazor WebAssembly App project template to build your first Blazor WebAssembly application Use templated components and the Razor class library to build and share a modal dialog box Understand how to use JavaScript with Blazor WebAssembly Build a progressive web app (PWA) to enable native app-like performance and speed Understand dependency injection (DI) in .NET to build a shopping cart app Get to grips with .NET Web APIs by building a task manager app Who this book is for This book is for .NET web developers who are tired of constantly learning new JavaScript frameworks and wish to write web applications using Blazor WebAssembly, leveraging the power of .NET and C#.

However, JavaScript developers have always wanted to use machine learning in the browser as well. This book focuses on how Danfo.js brings data processing, analysis, and ML tools to JavaScript developers and how to make the most of this library to build data-driven applications. Starting with an overview of modern JavaScript, you'll cover data analysis and transformation with Danfo.js and Dnotebook. The book then shows you how to load different datasets, combine and analyze them by performing operations such as handling missing values and string manipulations. You'll also get to grips with data plotting, visualization, aggregation, and group operations by combining Danfo.js with Plotly. As you advance, you'll create a no-code data analysis and handling system and create-react-app, react-table, react-chart, Draggable.js, and tailwindcss, and understand how to use TensorFlow.js and Danfo.js to build a recommendation system. Finally, you'll build a Twitter analytics dashboard powered by Danfo.js, Next.js, node-nlp, and Twit.js. By the end of this app development book, you'll be able to build and embed data analytics, visualization, and ML capabilities into any JavaScript app in server-side Node.js or the browser. What You Will Learn: Perform data experimentation and analysis with Danfo.js and Dnotebook Build machine learning applications using Danfo.js integrated with TensorFlow.js Connect Danfo.js with popular database applications to aid data analysis Create a no-code data analysis and handling system using internal libraries Develop a recommendation system with Danfo.js and TensorFlow.js Build a Twitter analytics dashboard for sentiment analysis and other types of data insights Who this book is for: This book is for data analysts, data scientists, and JavaScript developers who want to create data-driven applications in the JavaScript/Node.js environment.
