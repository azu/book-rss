You’ll learn how to work with JavaScript objects, creating and setting properties, defining and using methods and the way objects are used in the Document Object Model (DOM). All while kicking serious zombie tuchus. Speaking of the DOM you’ll become comfortable working with it, selecting elements out of it, creating elements and adding them to it and removing any apocalyptic elements that might slip through. Once you have all that under your post-apocalyptic utility belt you’ll then be introduced to events, event handlers and how to utilize them. By the end of this book you should be ready to manipulate a web page into post-apocalyptic submission (which is like normal submission except it’s, you know, like, after the apocalypse). How You'll Learn to Smack Zombies Around You won't just passively take in the view, like a zombie shuffling across the mainland. You’ll have plenty of combat practice with analogies, examples, and code tutorials you can build, break and fix again. Working with your hands and your head you’ll craft code that pleases the eye and knocks a zombie into last Tuesday. All the code and directions are provided as both codepen tutorials and downloadable html files, so you can fight the apocalypse how and where you like. You can work with them on the codepen site or on your own device. And later you'll bring those skills together in a final project that cements those skills into zombie smashing muscle memory. Why Zombies? Are zombies just a gimmick? Why would this be any better than a straight laced book that sticks to the facts? Straight laced books are often straight boring. And if you have insomnia problems go buy that book. The author, John, has read the boring books and knows that staying awake and engaged are also important for learning. But this book uses zombie references and analogies not just to make you smile, but to help the material stick. If a tough technical concept is related in silly terms you understand, like a zombie trying to buy gum at a super market, it’s much more likely to stay in that brain those zombies are intent on eating.<br><blockquote>The author, John, has read the boring books and knows that staying awake and engaged are also important for learning.
