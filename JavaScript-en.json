Each chapter covers a particular part of an application, introducing you to modern techniques and architectural patterns for achieving it—with a practical focus on the most popular tools, libraries, and frameworks used by today’s full-stack developers. You’ll learn to build an entire application from start to finish, from creating a Node.js server, to developing a front-end interface with React.js components and Next.js pages. You’ll then expand your web application by writing REST and GraphQL APIs, implementing middleware, and connecting your application to a MongoDB database on the back end. Finally, you’ll learn how to add OAuth authorization to your application, write automated tests with Jest, and deploy your project as microservices using Docker.

This book is filled with examples that enable you to leverage the latest JavaScript and TypeScript versions to produce modern and clean code, as well as teach you to how apply functional programming techniques to develop more efficient algorithms, write more concise code, and simplify unit testing. This book provides comprehensive coverage of the major topics in functional programming to produce shorter, clearer, and testable programs. You'll begin by getting to grips with writing and testing pure functions, reducing side effects, as well as other key features to make your applications functional in nature. The book specifically explores techniques to simplify coding, apply recursion, perform high-level coding, learn ways to achieve immutability, implement design patterns, and work with data types. By the end of this book, you'll have developed the practical programming skills needed to confidently enhance your applications by adding functional programming to wherever it's most suitable. What you will learn Understand when to use functional programming versus classic object-oriented programming Use declarative coding instead of imperative coding for clearer, more understandable code Know how to avoid side effects and create more reliable code with closures and immutable data Use recursion to help design and implement more understandable solutions to complex problems Define functional programing data types with or without TypeScript, add type checking, and implement immutability Apply advanced containers to get better structures to tackle errors and implement async programming Who this book is for If you are a JavaScript or TypeScript developer looking to enhance your programming skills, then this book is for you.
