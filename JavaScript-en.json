In modern JavaScript, instead of callbacks you'll use promises to improve your application's performance and responsiveness. JavaScript features introduced in ES2020, ES2021, and ESNext like Promise.allSettled(), Promise.any(), and top-level await help you develop small, fast, low-profile applications. With the AbortController API, cancel a pending async request before it has completed. Modern Asynchronous JavaScript gives you an arsenal of tools to build programs that always respond to user requests, recover quickly from difficult conditions, and deliver maximum performance. Applications today must work with information on remote servers, and users expect a quick response to complex interactions at all times, whether on a high-speed 5G cellular network or slow public WiFi. JavaScript provides developers with advanced tools to coordinate the asynchronous parts of their code efficiently and deliver responsive programs. Faster applications equal happier users, which is the promise of asynchronous JavaScript. With Modern Asynchronous JavaScript you'll learn techniques for managing your async code. Features like ES2021 Promise.any() allow you to safeguard your async code from external issues that are out of your control like server downtime. You'll discover secret weapons like top-level await to initialize resources, define dependency paths dynamically, and load dependencies with a fallback implementation. You'll even learn to how to set a time limit for async requests and react if they take too long to complete. Fast, reliable applications are a must in today's world, where users demand increasingly greater amounts of data on mobile devices. Asynchronous programming may require more cautious planning than synchronous programming but the outcome is rewarding. Asynchronous JavaScript allows you to write code that is nimble but reliable, leading to programs that load faster, respond quicker, and most importantly that you can trust to function properly. What You Need: You'll need an intermediate level of JavaScript programming skills and a browser that supports features from ES2020, ES2021, and ESNext.<br><blockquote>Modern Asynchronous JavaScript gives you an arsenal of tools to build programs that always respond to user requests, recover quickly from difficult conditions, and deliver maximum performance.</blockquote>",

This web application development book provides you with all the Django tools you need to simplify your developments with real-time results. You'll learn state-of-the-art WebSocket techniques to realize real-time applications with minimal reliance on JavaScript. This book will also show you how to create a project with Docker from the ground up, test it, and deploy it on a server. You'll learn how to create a project, add Docker, and discover development libraries, Django channels, and bidirectional communication, and from then, on you'll create real projects of all kinds using HTML over WebSockets as a chat app or a blog with real-time comments. In addition, you'll modernize your development techniques by moving from using an SSR model to creating web pages using WebSockets over HTML. With Django, you'll be able to create SPAs with professional real-time projects where the logic is in Python. By the end of this Django book, you'll be able to build real-time applications, as well as gaining a solid understanding of WebSockets with Django. What You Will Learn: Explore real-time site realization Understand the proper use of Django channels Find out how to set up Docker with Django Discover how to use a JavaScript framework such as Stimulus Manage a database asynchronously in Django Bring dynamic rendering logic to the backend Who this book is for: This book is for developers looking to build applications where they want to bring logic to the backend, learn WebSockets, and not depend on JavaScript heavily to create a single-page application.

            "summary": "Discover how to construct real-time applications with Python and Django without the hassle of learning JavaScript Key Features: Learn to put together an SPA using Python and very little JavaScript Create WebSocket communication between the backend and frontend Build a real-world project with Django using the techniques provided in this book Book Description: The HTML over WebSockets approach simplifies single-page application (SPA) development and lets you bypass learning a JavaScript rendering framework such as React, Vue, or Angular, moving the logic to Python. This web application development book provides you with all the Django tools you need to simplify your developments with real-time results. You'll learn state-of-the-art WebSocket techniques to realize real-time applications with minimal reliance on JavaScript. This book will also show you how to create a project with Docker from the ground up, test it, and deploy it on a server. You'll learn how to create a project, add Docker, and discover development libraries, Django channels, and bidirectional communication, and from then, on you'll create real projects of all kinds using HTML over WebSockets as a chat app or a blog with real-time comments. In addition, you'll modernize your development techniques by moving from using an SSR model to creating web pages using WebSockets over HTML. With Django, you'll be able to create SPAs with professional real-time projects where the logic is in Python. By the end of this Django book, you'll be able to build real-time applications, as well as gaining a solid understanding of WebSockets with Django. What You Will Learn: Explore real-time site realization Understand the proper use of Django channels Find out how to set up Docker with Django Discover how to use a JavaScript framework such as Stimulus Manage a database asynchronously in Django Bring dynamic rendering logic to the backend Who this book is for: This book is for developers looking to build applications where they want to bring logic to the backend, learn WebSockets, and not depend on JavaScript heavily to create a single-page application. Basic knowledge of HTML and Python and familiarity with basic web development concepts is expected.",
