Used by Nike, Costa Coffee, and other companies worldwide, Gatsby is emerging as one of the key technologies in the Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs, and markup) ecosystem. With this comprehensive guide, you'll learn how to architect, build, and deploy Gatsby sites independently or with CMSs, commerce systems, and other data sources. Author Preston So begins by showing you how to set up a Gatsby site from scratch. From there, you창??ll learn ways to use Gatsby창??s declarative rendering and GraphQL API, build complex offline-enabled sites, and continuously deploy Gatsby sites on a variety of platforms, including Gatsby Cloud. Discover how Gatsby integrates with many data sources and plug-ins Set up, configure, and architect Gatsby sites using Gatsby's CLI, React, JSX, and GraphQL with high performance out of the box Build an independent Gatsby site based on Markdown and data- and content-driven Gatsby sites that integrate with CMSs and commerce platforms Deploy Gatsby sites with full CI/CD and test coverage on a variety of platforms, including Netlify, Vercel, and Gatsby Cloud<br><blockquote>Get the definitive guide on Gatsby, the JavaScript framework for building blazing fast websites and applications.</blockquote>",

The only technical requirement for using Blazor WebAssembly is a browser that supports WebAssembly, which, as of today, all modern browsers do. Blazor WebAssembly by Example is a project-based guide for learning how to build single-page web applications using the Blazor WebAssembly framework. This book emphasizes the practical over the theoretical by providing detailed step-by-step instructions for each project. You'll start by building simple standalone web applications and progress to developing more advanced hosted web applications with SQL Server backends. Each project covers a different aspect of the Blazor WebAssembly ecosystem, such as Razor components, JavaScript interop, event handling, application state, and dependency injection. The book is designed in such a way that you can complete the projects in any order. By the end of this book, you will have experience building a wide variety of single-page web applications with .NET, Blazor WebAssembly, and C#. What you will learn Discover the power of the C# language for both server-side and client-side web development Use the Blazor WebAssembly App project template to build your first Blazor WebAssembly application Use templated components and the Razor class library to build and share a modal dialog box Understand how to use JavaScript with Blazor WebAssembly Build a progressive web app (PWA) to enable native app-like performance and speed Understand dependency injection (DI) in .NET to build a shopping cart app Get to grips with .NET Web APIs by building a task manager app Who this book is for This book is for .NET web developers who are tired of constantly learning new JavaScript frameworks and wish to write web applications using Blazor WebAssembly, leveraging the power of .NET and C#. The book assumes beginner-level knowledge of the C# language, .NET framework, Microsoft Visual Studio, and web development concepts.<br><blockquote>By the end of this book, you will have experience building a wide variety of single-page web applications with .NET, Blazor WebAssembly, and C#.
