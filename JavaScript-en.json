Anyone can learn to do that easily, you just need the right framework to pair with the programming language of your choice! If you're interested in developing software for a diverse range of computers and operating systems, including Microsoft Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, MacOS, and Linux based operating systems like Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch Linux, etc. then electron is the right choice of framework for you. Learning Electron is a journey comprised of getting to know it's workflow, APIs, etc. Its easy enough to be learned just by reading Electron's documentation, however, if you wish to master the full power of Electron, you need to use it with all it's advanced features, complementing Electron-userland programs, and Typescript; This book can be used to assist you in your journey to learn and master desktop software development, and help you avoid the heartache that comes with the steep learning curve of Electron at it's full power.What you can find inside this book: You will find the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, ES6, and Electron, so you can easily get acquainted with it even if you have never used Electron or NodeJS before. The basics are thorough and dense in print, so even if you are an intermediate or advanced user, you can learn stuff you may have never seen before. Advanced features like Data-type Prejudice, Class Based OOP, Scaffolding, Boilerplate code, Crash Report handling, Working with I/O devices, Debugging, Testing, etc. are covered for intermediate and Advanced users. Heavy attention has been given to the practicals, demonstrations, and code narrations. Advanced coding practices are covered, and a wide range of alternatives and suggestions are provided to improve your overall experience with Electron and JavaScript. The lessons are presented in a way that enhances the learning experience when the book is used as a self-learning material. The explanations and code narrations are provide in a way that assists rote learning, if the need ever arises! The past and future of Desktop Applications is discussed at length, and an entire chapter is provided to inspire and inform readers who are interested in applying Electron and JavaScript to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Internet of Things, etc. Instructions are given to use Electron with both JavaScript and TypeScript. Instructions are given to extend your journey to program and develop using Electron beyond this book. A lot of informative material is provided to get you acquainted with the Electron-userland. This book will take care of all your Electron related needs! It will teach you all you need to learn, and it will tell you all you need to know! This book will make you fall in love with Electron and JavaScript; you will be able to develop Desktop Applications before you know it!<br><blockquote>It will teach you all you need to learn, and it will tell you all you need to know!

This e-book is a gentler introduction to JavaScript. The real issues in learning JavaScript is either not understanding the basic concept clearly or overwhelmed by too much detailed learning resources. To encounter these issues, this e-book is created. It is a small book but the content is well balanced and focuses only on core JavaScript Programming area. The benefit of this book is extended to all groups from beginners to expert levels. If you are a visual learner, this book can be a great aid. Each and every component of JavaScript like loops, variables, built-in data structures and functions are made interactive with images and examples. The code for each function can be executed step-wise, and the output can be checked in real time. The book also shed some lights on OOPs concept to get a good grip over the language. Framework like AngularJS, Backbone, Bootstrap, etc. comes handy after referring to this book. You will be able to build a simple web app by the end of this book.
