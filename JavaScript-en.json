Using examples of ReScript language features along with explanations of fundamental concepts in functional programming, this book will show web developers with a background in JavaScript how to effectively use ReScript to its full potential. In Introducing ReScript, you'll learn how to use features in ReScript that JavaScript lacks, such as type inference, null-safety, algebraic data types, pattern matching, and more. Along the way, you'll pick up functional programming concepts like immutability and higher-order functions. You'll also gain a sense of how ReScript works under the hood and how to leverage interoperability between ReScript and JavaScript. Whether you're a web developer interested in dabbling with functional programming or you just want to learn how to write safer and cleaner code for web applications, this book is a great way for you to get started with ReScript. What You Will Learn Use ReScript to write clean, safe, and elegant software Understand the features of ReScript that set it apart from JavaScript, such as type inference, null-safety, and algebraic data types Explore functional programming concepts like immutabhigher-orderr order functions, and pattern matching Use popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks in your ReScript code and integrate ReScript code into JavaScript codebases Who This Book Is For Web developers that want a strictly typed, safer alternative to JavaScript, as well as web developers interested in learning functional programming and leveraging the elegant and powerful functional features in ReScript.<br><blockquote>This book serves as a succinct guide on ReScript, a functional language for building web applications.</blockquote>",

React Native is an open-source JavaScript framework that allows you to create applications for many platforms, including iOS, Android, and the web, all with the same code base. It is built on the React framework, and it provides all of React’s power to mobile app development. React Native was a natural continuation of React. It is a mobile framework that includes JavaScript to create near-native apps. JSX, a hybrid of JavaScript and XML-like markup, is used to make React Native applications. The React Native “bridge” then calls the native rendering APIs in Objective-C (for iOS) or Java (for Android) behind the scenes (for Android). As a result, your app will appear and feel like any other mobile app, as it will be rendered using genuine mobile UI components instead of web views. React Native also offers JavaScript interfaces for platform APIs, allowing your React Native apps to use features such as user location and the phone camera. If your app is UI focused, React Native is an excellent choice because it comes with an extensive UI library. Becoming a React Native developer gives you access to exciting, cutting-edge projects which frequently incorporate innovative technology like Augmented Reality. Job opportunities for React Native devs are aplenty, and it is undoubtedly a skill worthy of consideration owing to its popularity with startups and corporates alike. With Mastering React Native, learning React Native becomes easy and will help readers undoubtedly advance their careers.

Vue is a popular JavaScript front-end framework that is rapidly expanding. It is easy to use, small (less than 24 KB), and really fast. It is simple to include in other applications and libraries. Vue.js is easy to install, and beginners may quickly learn how to use it and begin creating their interface design. What makes Vue special is that it is different from most other JavaScript frameworks and libraries. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is built from the ground up to be incrementally adaptable. The core library focuses primarily on the View layer, and is easy to use and combine with other libraries or projects. On the other hand, when merged with contemporary stacks and libraries, Vue is perfectly capable of running powerful Single-Page Web Applications. Working with Vue.js can be fun. Leveraging Vue and its plugins can help one easily create excellent Internet and smartphone-compatible applications. Vue is both compact and customizable, and comes with multiple capabilities for intelligent state management and navigation choices. All said and done, learning Vue is an excellent career initiative, especially since it is rapidly gaining favor among startups and established enterprises alike. Vue is an excellent choice if you want to make a highly engaging, flexible, and data-driven app. It has an easy-to-understand layout which you can learn in minutes. Unlike Angular or React, Vue.js does not have a lot of challenges or concepts to master.
