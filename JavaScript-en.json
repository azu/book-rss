But thanks to language advancements such as web workers in the browser, JavaScript is now a multithreaded language. What does that mean for you? In this practical book, authors Thomas Hunter II and Bryan English explain JavaScript threads as a programming concept and tool. Not every problem needs to be solved with threads, but having this tool in your toolbox will help you arrive at the most appropriate solution. This book explores various features that JavaScript runtimes have at their disposal for implementing multithreaded programs. By exploring practical real-world examples, you'll discover when to use threads and when not to. Learn what multithreaded programming is and how you can benefit from it Understand the differences between a web worker, a service worker, and a worker thread Know when and when not to use threads in an application Orchestrate communication between threads by leveraging the Atomics object Build high-performance applications using the knowledge you gain from this book Benchmark performance to learn if you'll benefit from multithreading<br><blockquote>Learn what multithreaded programming is and how you can benefit from it Understand the differences between a web worker, a service worker, and a worker thread Know when and when not to use threads in an application Orchestrate communication ...</blockquote>",

You’ll learn how to work with JavaScript objects, creating and setting properties, defining and using methods and the way objects are used in the Document Object Model (DOM). All while kicking serious zombie tuchus. Speaking of the DOM you’ll become comfortable working with it, selecting elements out of it, creating elements and adding them to it and removing any apocalyptic elements that might slip through. Once you have all that under your post-apocalyptic utility belt you’ll then be introduced to events, event handlers and how to utilize them. By the end of this book you should be ready to manipulate a web page into post-apocalyptic submission (which is like normal submission except it’s, you know, like, after the apocalypse). How You'll Learn to Smack Zombies Around You won't just passively take in the view, like a zombie shuffling across the mainland. You’ll have plenty of combat practice with analogies, examples, and code tutorials you can build, break and fix again. Working with your hands and your head you’ll craft code that pleases the eye and knocks a zombie into last Tuesday. All the code and directions are provided as both codepen tutorials and downloadable html files, so you can fight the apocalypse how and where you like. You can work with them on the codepen site or on your own device. And later you'll bring those skills together in a final project that cements those skills into zombie smashing muscle memory. Why Zombies? Are zombies just a gimmick? Why would this be any better than a straight laced book that sticks to the facts? Straight laced books are often straight boring. And if you have insomnia problems go buy that book. The author, John, has read the boring books and knows that staying awake and engaged are also important for learning. But this book uses zombie references and analogies not just to make you smile, but to help the material stick. If a tough technical concept is related in silly terms you understand, like a zombie trying to buy gum at a super market, it’s much more likely to stay in that brain those zombies are intent on eating.<br><blockquote>The author, John, has read the boring books and knows that staying awake and engaged are also important for learning.
