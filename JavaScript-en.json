For starters, compared to other languages like C and Java, JavaScript is generally easier to learn. When we say 'easier', we mean in terms of how quickly you can go from being a JavaScript novice to someone who can actually make a living writing professional, high quality JavaScript code. So, in that sense, it's more accessible than some other languages like C and Java.JavaScript is also a fun and rewarding language, which is especially important when you're just getting started in software development. The community support is very good, so if you get stuck, there's a good chance that the problem and its solution already exist on the web.Now that we've gotten a bird's-eye view of JavaScript, let's get into the more technical detail. JavaScript was created to add 'life to webpages'. Just like HTML and CSS, JavaScript is written in plain text files with a .js extension.As previously mentioned, JavaScript can be used to accomplish many useful operations on the frontend, like validating forms, alerting users, storing temporary data, and performing calculations-to name just a few.Pro tip: Apart from the name itself, JavaScript has no relation to Java.

The book begins with the history of web development and JavaScript, how it has evolved over these years, and how it still keeps growing with new features. Next, you will learn the basic pillars of web development - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will learn about the functional, object-oriented programming and asynchronous behaviour, and how JavaScript provides for these. Empowered with the basics, you will proceed to learn the new features of JavaScript, ES2015, and the latest ES2019. Next, you will apply your learning to build a real application to see how the Web takes shape.At the end, you will also have an introductory section on ReactJS, one of the modern frameworks for UI development and also develop a simple weather application using React. You will be introduced to Redux as the state container for React applications. This book will conclude with an introductory look at additional topics which can be taken up to become a professional and in building enterprise level applications. WHAT WILL YOU LEARN By the end of the book, you will be building real web applications to put your knowledge to practice. This book introduces all the concepts to get started with web application development. To further excel in this field, you really need to practice by building a lot many applications, implementing your own ideas or imitating existing websites. Also remember to practice additional examples provided in the code bundle of the book to master this field. WHO THIS BOOK IS FOR This book can be used by people who are completely new to software development and want to get into front-end web development by starting from basics.
