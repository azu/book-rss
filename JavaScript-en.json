            "content_html": "Improve the user experience for your Rails app with rich, engaging client-side interactions. Learn to use the Rails 6 tools and simplify the complex JavaScript ecosystem. It's easier than ever to build user interactions with the Webpacker gem and Stimulus. You can add great front-end flair without much extra complication. Add React to build an even more extensive set of client-side features. Structure your code for different levels of client-side needs with these powerful options. Add to your toolkit today! It's hard to have a Rails application without integrating some client-side logic. But client-side coding tools, and the Rails tools for integrating with them, all change continuously. Rails 6 simplifies client-side integration with the Webpacker gem. It's the default tool for building client-side assets for use by web browsers. Learn how to use Rails 6 and Webpacker to build rich front-end logic into your Rails applications. The job is even easier with Stimulus, a library that brings Rails conventions to JavaScript tools. Add in some React, a popular framework that automatically updates the browser when your data changes. Learn the basics of webpack, Webpacker, and TypeScript, and add pizazz to your application. Structure your web application to best manage your state. Learn how to interact with data on the server while still keeping the user experience interactive. Use the type system in TypeScript to expand on JavaScript and help prevent error conditions. Debug and test your front-end application with tools specific to each framework. There are a lot of ways to do client-side coding, and Rails is here to help. What You Need: This book requires Ruby on Rails 6.0+, React 16.8.0+. Other dependencies will be added by Rails.<br><blockquote>Debug and test your front-end application with tools specific to each framework.

This is done by providing the reader with real-world examples of how a variety of different JavaScript and PHP based libraries can be used to gather data using custom feedback forms and embedded data gathering tools. Once data has been gathered, this book explores the process of working with numerical data, text analysis, visualization approaches, statistics and rolling out developed applications to both data analysists and users alike. Using the collected data, this book aims to provide a deeper understanding of user behavior and interests allowing application developers to further enhance web application development. Key Features: Complete real-world examples of gathering data from users and web environments Offers readers the fundamentals of text analysis using JavaScript and PHP Allows the user to understand and harness JavaScript data visualization tools Integration of new and existing data sources into a single bespoke web-based analysis environment Author Bio: Dr. Kyle Goslin is currently a Lecturer in Computing at the Technological University Dublin in Ireland, specializing in web application development, information retrieval, text analysis and data visualization.
