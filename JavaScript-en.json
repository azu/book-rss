Since the publication of its first edition in 1984 and its second edition in 1996, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) has influenced computer science curricula around the world. Widely adopted as a textbook, the book has its origins in a popular entry-level computer science course taught by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman at MIT. SICP introduces the reader to central ideas of computation by establishing a series of mental models for computation. Earlier editions used the programming language Scheme in their program examples. This new version of the second edition has been adapted for JavaScript. The first three chapters of SICP cover programming concepts that are common to all modern high-level programming languages. Chapters four and five, which used Scheme to formulate language processors for Scheme, required significant revision. Chapter four offers new material, in particular an introduction to the notion of program parsing. The evaluator and compiler in chapter five introduce a subtle stack discipline to support return statements (a prominent feature of statement-oriented languages) without sacrificing tail recursion. The JavaScript programs included in the book run in any implementation of the language that complies with the ECMAScript 2020 specification, using the JavaScript package sicp provided by the MIT Press website.<br><blockquote>Widely adopted as a textbook, the book has its origins in a popular entry-level computer science course taught by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman at MIT.</blockquote>",

            "content_html": "JavaScript today must interact with data-intensive APIs and networks. The solution is a program that can work asynchronously instead of finishing tasks in order. In modern JavaScript, instead of callbacks you'll use promises to improve your application's performance and responsiveness. JavaScript features introduced in ES2020, ES2021, and ESNext like Promise.allSettled(), Promise.any(), and top-level await help you develop small, fast, low-profile applications. With the AbortController API, cancel a pending async request before it has completed. Modern Asynchronous JavaScript gives you an arsenal of tools to build programs that always respond to user requests, recover quickly from difficult conditions, and deliver maximum performance. Applications today must work with information on remote servers, and users expect a quick response to complex interactions at all times, whether on a high-speed 5G cellular network or slow public WiFi. JavaScript provides developers with advanced tools to coordinate the asynchronous parts of their code efficiently and deliver responsive programs. Faster applications equal happier users, which is the promise of asynchronous JavaScript. With Modern Asynchronous JavaScript you'll learn techniques for managing your async code. Features like ES2021 Promise.any() allow you to safeguard your async code from external issues that are out of your control like server downtime. You'll discover secret weapons like top-level await to initialize resources, define dependency paths dynamically, and load dependencies with a fallback implementation. You'll even learn to how to set a time limit for async requests and react if they take too long to complete. Fast, reliable applications are a must in today's world, where users demand increasingly greater amounts of data on mobile devices. Asynchronous programming may require more cautious planning than synchronous programming but the outcome is rewarding. Asynchronous JavaScript allows you to write code that is nimble but reliable, leading to programs that load faster, respond quicker, and most importantly that you can trust to function properly. What You Need: You'll need an intermediate level of JavaScript programming skills and a browser that supports features from ES2020, ES2021, and ESNext.<br><blockquote>Modern Asynchronous JavaScript gives you an arsenal of tools to build programs that always respond to user requests, recover quickly from difficult conditions, and deliver maximum performance.</blockquote>",
