Although the initial focus of the language was to assist in the generation of dynamic web content, it soon found its way into numerous other applications. This book aims to cover the fundamentals of the language by providing a strong start for people who wish to start their journey to the JavaScript programming language. It provides the mandatory theoretical background, which is much needed for implementation of the exhaustive hands-on exercises and includes over 4000 lines of code for grasping a maximum understanding of the material. FEATURES A strong theoretical background and understanding of the fundamentals of the JavaScript language Hands-on and demo exercises at the end of every chapter Exercises, theory-based questions, MCQs and true/false questions for helping readers to evaluate their understanding from time to time A dedicated chapter providing extended case studies for using the language This book is targeted at undergraduate as well as postgraduate students who want to learn about front-end programming or who wish to learn a lightweight, easy-to-use programming language for working on their projects. For programmers having experience in other languages, it will serve as a quick summary to get a hold of a new language.<br><blockquote>This book aims to cover the fundamentals of the language by providing a strong start for people who wish to start their journey to the JavaScript programming language.</blockquote>",
