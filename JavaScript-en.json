The book is extremely user-friendly. It assumes no programming experience and helps the students to learn the JavaScript in step by step manner with the help of illustrative examples. The first two units cover the fundamental concepts of JavaScript such as variables, operators, control structures, arrays, functions and strings. In the third unit, the concept of form and event handling is discussed. This feature of JavaScript help us to design the interactive web page with graphical user interface. In the next subsequent chapter, the book demonstrates how to create and manage cookies, how to create browser history, implementation of form validation with the help of regular expressions, creating rollover effects and creating and handling frames. At the end, the book illustrates creation of banner, management of status bar and creation of slideshows using JavaScript. This book serves the purpose of teaching JavaScript in the simplest and easiest manner.<br><blockquote>At the end, the book illustrates creation of banner, management of status bar and creation of slideshows using JavaScript.

These distinctive features made node.js as one of the most powerful framework in the Java Ecosystem. JavaScript alone allows you to build real-time and scalable mobile and web applications. With this e-book, you will explore more on the node.js framework and how to use it efficiently for web development. Average developers or beginners who struggle to understand node.js basics will find this book very helpful and productive. The book tried to put examples that simplify problems usually faced by the users like how asynchronous code works, what are modules, how big file can be read, node.js express, etc. You will find that lots of concepts that take a long time to master can be learned in a day or two. If this is your first interaction with node.js and don’t want all sort of troubles that arise with the node, this edition is recommended. After going through this e-book, node.js will become an absolute pleasure. Table of content Chapter 1: Introduction 1. Introduction to Node.js 2. What is Node.js? 3. Why use Node.js? 4.
