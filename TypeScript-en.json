This book is an easy, hands-on introduction to the creation of web applications from the ground up. Each chapter covers a particular part of an application, introducing you to modern techniques and architectural patterns for achieving it—with a practical focus on the most popular tools, libraries, and frameworks used by today’s full-stack developers. You’ll learn to build an entire application from start to finish, from creating a Node.js server, to developing a front-end interface with React.js components and Next.js pages. You’ll then expand your web application by writing REST and GraphQL APIs, implementing middleware, and connecting your application to a MongoDB database on the back end. Finally, you’ll learn how to add OAuth authorization to your application, write automated tests with Jest, and deploy your project as microservices using Docker. You’ll learn: Contemporary best practices, like the use of a microservice architecture and test-driven development techniques Essential concepts of the tools, frameworks, and full-stack technologies, and how to use them Steps for creating a full-stack web application—from React.js components on the front end, to GraphQL APIs in the middleware and the MongoDB database on the back end How to add OAuth authorization to integrate login with GitHub and write automated tests with Jest<br><blockquote>This book is an easy, hands-on introduction to the creation of web applications from the ground up.</blockquote>",

Helps develop maintainable and scalable TypeScript code. DESCRIPTION This book provides a comprehensive guide to TypeScript, a programming language that extends JavaScript with powerful features like static typing, classes, and interfaces. The book is divided into thirteen chapters that cover everything from setting up a development environment to building an Angular app with TypeScript. We start with an introduction to TypeScript and its benefits and go on to explain how TypeScript can help developers write more maintainable, scalable code and catch errors before they make it to production. The book then dives into more technical topics like basic type annotations, using the TypeScript compiler, advanced features like enums and interfaces, and manipulating types. The book then discusses chapters on classes and control flow analysis that are particularly helpful for developers looking to build more complex applications. The book teaches by example, with numerous code examples that illustrate the main concepts and approaches towards writing TypeScript programs and codes, and finishes with a comprehensive practical example that shows step-by-step development of a modern web application using TypeScript and Angular. WHAT WILL YOU LEARN ● Learn how to create a new TypeScript project with default settings and configurations. ● Discover how to incorporate basic type-annotations into your code for improved clarity and accuracy. ● Explore the use of type-aliases, interfaces, and enums to write more organized and expressive TypeScript code. ● Gain knowledge on building modular and error-free applications in TypeScript. ● Discover how to leverage type-guards, classes, and other TypeScript utilities to write more robust code. ● Learn how to work with advanced features like generics and take your TypeScript skills to the next level. WHO IS THIS BOOK FOR? This book is targeted towards front-end developers who are familiar with JavaScript and are interested in expanding their skillset with TypeScript. Whether you are a beginner with little to no experience or an intermediate developer looking for a reference guide, this book is designed to help you supercharge your development and enhance your tooling. With its clear and concise explanations, it's perfect for those who are new to TypeScript and looking to gain a deeper understanding of its capabilities.

What you will learn Understand when to use functional programming versus classic object-oriented programming Use declarative coding instead of imperative coding for clearer, more understandable code Know how to avoid side effects and create more reliable code with closures and immutable data Use recursion to help design and implement more understandable solutions to complex problems Define functional programing data types with or without TypeScript, add type checking, and implement immutability Apply advanced containers to get better structures to tackle errors and implement async programming Who this book is for If you are a JavaScript or TypeScript developer looking to enhance your programming skills, then this book is for you. The book applies to both frontend developers working with frameworks such as React, Vue, or Angular as well as backend developers using Node.js or Deno.",
