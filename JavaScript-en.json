The first two units cover the fundamental concepts of JavaScript such as variables, operators, control structures, arrays, functions and strings. In the third unit, the concept of form and event handling is discussed. This feature of JavaScript help us to design the interactive web page with graphical user interface. In the next subsequent chapter, the book demonstrates how to create and manage cookies, how to create browser history, implementation of form validation with the help of regular expressions, creating rollover effects and creating and handling frames. At the end, the book illustrates creation of banner, management of status bar and creation of slideshows using JavaScript.
