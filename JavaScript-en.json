In this practical book, author Kyran Dale shows data scientists and analysts--as well as Python and JavaScript developers--how to create the ideal toolchain for the job. By providing engaging examples and stressing hard-earned best practices, this guide teaches you how to leverage the power of best-of-breed Python and JavaScript libraries. Python provides accessible, powerful, and mature libraries for scraping, cleaning, and processing data. And while JavaScript is the best language when it comes to programming web visualizations, its data processing abilities can't compare with Python's. Together, these two languages are a perfect complement for creating a modern web-visualization toolchain. This book gets you started. You'll learn how to: Obtain data you need programmatically, using scraping tools or web APIs: Requests, Scrapy, Beautiful Soup Clean and process data using Python's heavyweight data processing libraries within the NumPy ecosystem: Jupyter notebooks with pandas+Matplotlib+Seaborn Deliver the data to a browser with static files or by using Flask, the lightweight Python server, and a RESTful API Pick up enough web development skills (HTML, CSS, JS) to get your visualized data on the web Use the data you've mined and refined to create web charts and visualizations with Plotly, D3, Leaflet, and other libraries<br><blockquote>In this practical book, author Kyran Dale shows data scientists and analysts--as well as Python and JavaScript developers--how to create the ideal toolchain for the job.</blockquote>",

Widely adopted as a textbook, the book has its origins in a popular entry-level computer science course taught by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman at MIT. SICP introduces the reader to central ideas of computation by establishing a series of mental models for computation. Earlier editions used the programming language Scheme in their program examples. This new version of the second edition has been adapted for JavaScript. The first three chapters of SICP cover programming concepts that are common to all modern high-level programming languages. Chapters four and five, which used Scheme to formulate language processors for Scheme, required significant revision. Chapter four offers new material, in particular an introduction to the notion of program parsing. The evaluator and compiler in chapter five introduce a subtle stack discipline to support return statements (a prominent feature of statement-oriented languages) without sacrificing tail recursion.

The book contains extensive code samples in JavaScript, both for Node.js and for frontend apps running in a web browser, although the core concepts can be used by developers working with any programming language and framework. With a purely hands-on approach that is focused on sharing actionable knowledge, you'll learn about the common categories of cryptographic operations that you can leverage in all apps you're developing, including hashing, encryption with symmetric, asymmetric and hybrid ciphers, and digital signatures. You'll learn when to use these operations and how to choose and implement the most popular algorithms to perform them, including SHA-2, Argon2, AES, ChaCha20-Poly1305, RSA, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography. Later, you'll learn how to deal with password and key management. All code in this book is written in JavaScript and designed to run in Node.js or as part of frontend apps for web browsers. By the end of this book, you'll be able to build solutions that leverage cryptography to protect user privacy, offer better security against an expanding and more complex threat landscape, help meet data protection requirements, and unlock new opportunities. What You Will Learn: Write JavaScript code that uses cryptography running within a Node.js environment for the server-side or in frontend applications for web browsers Use modern, safe hashing functions for calculating digests and key derivation, including SHA-2 and Argon2 Practice encrypting messages and files with a symmetric key using AES and ChaCha20-Poly1305 Use asymmetric and hybrid encryption, leveraging RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography with ECDH and ECIES Calculate and verify digital signatures using RSA and ECDSA/EdDSA Manage passwords and encryption keys safely Who this book is for: This cryptography book is an introductory guide for software developers who don't necessarily have a background in cryptography but are interested in learning how to integrate it in their solutions, correctly and safely. You'll need to have at least intermediate-level knowledge of building apps with JavaScript and familiarity with Node.js to make the most of this book.<br><blockquote>Discover how to take advantage of common cryptographic operations to build safer apps that respect users&#39; privacy with the help of examples in JavaScript for Node.js and browsers Key Features: Understand how to implement common ...</blockquote>",

By the end of this book, you'll be able to build solutions that leverage cryptography to protect user privacy, offer better security against an expanding and more complex threat landscape, help meet data protection requirements, and unlock new opportunities. What You Will Learn: Write JavaScript code that uses cryptography running within a Node.js environment for the server-side or in frontend applications for web browsers Use modern, safe hashing functions for calculating digests and key derivation, including SHA-2 and Argon2 Practice encrypting messages and files with a symmetric key using AES and ChaCha20-Poly1305 Use asymmetric and hybrid encryption, leveraging RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography with ECDH and ECIES Calculate and verify digital signatures using RSA and ECDSA/EdDSA Manage passwords and encryption keys safely Who this book is for: This cryptography book is an introductory guide for software developers who don't necessarily have a background in cryptography but are interested in learning how to integrate it in their solutions, correctly and safely. You'll need to have at least intermediate-level knowledge of building apps with JavaScript and familiarity with Node.js to make the most of this book.",
