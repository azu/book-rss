Using examples of ReScript language features along with explanations of fundamental concepts in functional programming, this book will show web developers with a background in JavaScript how to effectively use ReScript to its full potential. In Introducing ReScript, you'll learn how to use features in ReScript that JavaScript lacks, such as type inference, null-safety, algebraic data types, pattern matching, and more. Along the way, you'll pick up functional programming concepts like immutability and higher-order functions. You'll also gain a sense of how ReScript works under the hood and how to leverage interoperability between ReScript and JavaScript. Whether you're a web developer interested in dabbling with functional programming or you just want to learn how to write safer and cleaner code for web applications, this book is a great way for you to get started with ReScript. What You Will Learn Use ReScript to write clean, safe, and elegant software Understand the features of ReScript that set it apart from JavaScript, such as type inference, null-safety, and algebraic data types Explore functional programming concepts like immutabhigher-orderr order functions, and pattern matching Use popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks in your ReScript code and integrate ReScript code into JavaScript codebases Who This Book Is For Web developers that want a strictly typed, safer alternative to JavaScript, as well as web developers interested in learning functional programming and leveraging the elegant and powerful functional features in ReScript.<br><blockquote>This book serves as a succinct guide on ReScript, a functional language for building web applications.</blockquote>",

Vue is a popular JavaScript front-end framework that is rapidly expanding. It is easy to use, small (less than 24 KB), and really fast. It is simple to include in other applications and libraries. Vue.js is easy to install, and beginners may quickly learn how to use it and begin creating their interface design. What makes Vue special is that it is different from most other JavaScript frameworks and libraries. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is built from the ground up to be incrementally adaptable. The core library focuses primarily on the View layer, and is easy to use and combine with other libraries or projects. On the other hand, when merged with contemporary stacks and libraries, Vue is perfectly capable of running powerful Single-Page Web Applications. Working with Vue.js can be fun. Leveraging Vue and its plugins can help one easily create excellent Internet and smartphone-compatible applications. Vue is both compact and customizable, and comes with multiple capabilities for intelligent state management and navigation choices. All said and done, learning Vue is an excellent career initiative, especially since it is rapidly gaining favor among startups and established enterprises alike. Vue is an excellent choice if you want to make a highly engaging, flexible, and data-driven app. It has an easy-to-understand layout which you can learn in minutes. Unlike Angular or React, Vue.js does not have a lot of challenges or concepts to master. It is an excellent choice for programmers looking to learn and implement new technology for their next project. With Mastering Vue.js, learning Vue becomes very straightforward, which will help readers undoubtedly advance their careers.

Add React to build an even more extensive set of client-side features. Structure your code for different levels of client-side needs with these powerful options. Add to your toolkit today! It's hard to have a Rails application without integrating some client-side logic. But client-side coding tools, and the Rails tools for integrating with them, all change continuously. Rails 6 simplifies client-side integration with the Webpacker gem. It's the default tool for building client-side assets for use by web browsers. Learn how to use Rails 6 and Webpacker to build rich front-end logic into your Rails applications. The job is even easier with Stimulus, a library that brings Rails conventions to JavaScript tools. Add in some React, a popular framework that automatically updates the browser when your data changes. Learn the basics of webpack, Webpacker, and TypeScript, and add pizazz to your application. Structure your web application to best manage your state. Learn how to interact with data on the server while still keeping the user experience interactive. Use the type system in TypeScript to expand on JavaScript and help prevent error conditions. Debug and test your front-end application with tools specific to each framework. There are a lot of ways to do client-side coding, and Rails is here to help. What You Need: This book requires Ruby on Rails 6.0+, React 16.8.0+.

            "summary": "Improve the user experience for your Rails app with rich, engaging client-side interactions. Learn to use the Rails 6 tools and simplify the complex JavaScript ecosystem. It's easier than ever to build user interactions with the Webpacker gem and Stimulus. You can add great front-end flair without much extra complication. Add React to build an even more extensive set of client-side features. Structure your code for different levels of client-side needs with these powerful options. Add to your toolkit today! It's hard to have a Rails application without integrating some client-side logic. But client-side coding tools, and the Rails tools for integrating with them, all change continuously. Rails 6 simplifies client-side integration with the Webpacker gem. It's the default tool for building client-side assets for use by web browsers. Learn how to use Rails 6 and Webpacker to build rich front-end logic into your Rails applications. The job is even easier with Stimulus, a library that brings Rails conventions to JavaScript tools. Add in some React, a popular framework that automatically updates the browser when your data changes. Learn the basics of webpack, Webpacker, and TypeScript, and add pizazz to your application. Structure your web application to best manage your state. Learn how to interact with data on the server while still keeping the user experience interactive. Use the type system in TypeScript to expand on JavaScript and help prevent error conditions. Debug and test your front-end application with tools specific to each framework. There are a lot of ways to do client-side coding, and Rails is here to help. What You Need: This book requires Ruby on Rails 6.0+, React 16.8.0+. Other dependencies will be added by Rails.",
