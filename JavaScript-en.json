            "content_html": "An accessible yet rigorous crash course on recursive programming using Python and JavaScript examples. Recursion, and recursive algorithms, have a reputation for being intimidating. They're seen as an advanced computer science topic often brought up in coding interviews. Moreover, coders often perceive the use of a recursive algorithm as a sophisticated solution that only true programmers can produce. But there's nothing magical about recursion. Its fearsome reputation is more a product of poor teaching than of the complexity of recursion itself. This book teaches the basics of recursion, exposes the ways it's often poorly taught, and clarifies the fundamental principles behind all recursive algorithms. It is project-based, containing complete, runnable programs in both Python and JavaScript, and covers several common recursive algorithms for tasks like calculating factorials, producing numbers in the Fibonacci sequence, tree traversal, maze solving, binary search, quicksort and merge sort, Karatsuba multiplication, permutations and combinations, and solving the eight queens problem. The book also explains tail call optimization and memoization, concepts often employed to produce effective recursive algorithms, and the call stack, which is a critical part of how recursive functions work but is almost never explicitly pointed out in lessons on recursion. The last chapter, on fractals, culminates with examples of the beautiful fractal shapes recursion can produce.<br><blockquote>This book teaches the basics of recursion, exposes the ways it&#39;s often poorly taught, and clarifies the fundamental principles behind all recursive algorithms.</blockquote>",

The only technical requirement for using Blazor WebAssembly is a browser that supports WebAssembly, which, as of today, all modern browsers do. Blazor WebAssembly by Example is a project-based guide for learning how to build single-page web applications using the Blazor WebAssembly framework. This book emphasizes the practical over the theoretical by providing detailed step-by-step instructions for each project. You'll start by building simple standalone web applications and progress to developing more advanced hosted web applications with SQL Server backends. Each project covers a different aspect of the Blazor WebAssembly ecosystem, such as Razor components, JavaScript interop, event handling, application state, and dependency injection. The book is designed in such a way that you can complete the projects in any order. By the end of this book, you will have experience building a wide variety of single-page web applications with .NET, Blazor WebAssembly, and C#. What you will learn Discover the power of the C# language for both server-side and client-side web development Use the Blazor WebAssembly App project template to build your first Blazor WebAssembly application Use templated components and the Razor class library to build and share a modal dialog box Understand how to use JavaScript with Blazor WebAssembly Build a progressive web app (PWA) to enable native app-like performance and speed Understand dependency injection (DI) in .NET to build a shopping cart app Get to grips with .NET Web APIs by building a task manager app Who this book is for This book is for .NET web developers who are tired of constantly learning new JavaScript frameworks and wish to write web applications using Blazor WebAssembly, leveraging the power of .NET and C#.
