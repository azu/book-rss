It's easier than ever to build user interactions with the Webpacker gem and Stimulus. You can add great front-end flair without much extra complication. Add React to build an even more extensive set of client-side features. Structure your code for different levels of client-side needs with these powerful options. Add to your toolkit today! It's hard to have a Rails application without integrating some client-side logic. But client-side coding tools, and the Rails tools for integrating with them, all change continuously. Rails 6 simplifies client-side integration with the Webpacker gem. It's the default tool for building client-side assets for use by web browsers. Learn how to use Rails 6 and Webpacker to build rich front-end logic into your Rails applications. The job is even easier with Stimulus, a library that brings Rails conventions to JavaScript tools. Add in some React, a popular framework that automatically updates the browser when your data changes. Learn the basics of webpack, Webpacker, and TypeScript, and add pizazz to your application. Structure your web application to best manage your state. Learn how to interact with data on the server while still keeping the user experience interactive. Use the type system in TypeScript to expand on JavaScript and help prevent error conditions. Debug and test your front-end application with tools specific to each framework. There are a lot of ways to do client-side coding, and Rails is here to help. What You Need: This book requires Ruby on Rails 6.0+, React 16.8.0+. Other dependencies will be added by Rails.<br><blockquote>Debug and test your front-end application with tools specific to each framework.

The book is extremely user-friendly. It assumes no programming experience and helps the students to learn the JavaScript in step by step manner with the help of illustrative examples. The first two units cover the fundamental concepts of JavaScript such as variables, operators, control structures, arrays, functions and strings. In the third unit, the concept of form and event handling is discussed. This feature of JavaScript help us to design the interactive web page with graphical user interface. In the next subsequent chapter, the book demonstrates how to create and manage cookies, how to create browser history, implementation of form validation with the help of regular expressions, creating rollover effects and creating and handling frames. At the end, the book illustrates creation of banner, management of status bar and creation of slideshows using JavaScript.

Master well-known design principles to create applications that are readable, extensible, and that can grow big. Key Features Learn how to create solid server-side applications by leveraging the full power of Node.js 14 Understand how Node.js works and learn how to take full advantage of its core components as well as the solutions offered by its ecosystem Avoid common mistakes and use proven patterns to create production grade Node.js applications Book Description In this book, we will show you how to implement a series of best practices and design patterns to help you create efficient and robust Node.js applications with ease. We kick off by exploring the basics of Node.js, analyzing its asynchronous event driven architecture and its fundamental design patterns. We then show you how to build asynchronous control flow patterns with callbacks, promises and async/await. Next, we dive into Node.js streams, unveiling their power and showing you how to use them at their full capacity. Following streams is an analysis of different creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns that take full advantage of JavaScript and Node.js. Lastly, the book dives into more advanced concepts such as Universal JavaScript, scalability and messaging patterns to help you build enterprise-grade distributed applications. Throughout the book, you’ll see Node.js in action with the help of several real-life examples leveraging technologies such as LevelDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, and many others. They will be used to demonstrate a pattern or technique, but they will also give you a great introduction to the Node.js ecosystem and its set of solutions. What you will learn Become comfortable with writing asynchronous code by leveraging callbacks, promises, and the async/await syntax Leverage Node.js streams to create data-driven asynchronous processing pipelines Implement well-known software design patterns to create production grade applications Share code between Node.js and the browser and take advantage of full-stack JavaScript Build and scale microservices and distributed systems powered by Node.js Use Node.js in conjunction with other powerful technologies such as Redis, RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, and LevelDB Who this book is for This book is for developers and software architects who have some prior basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js and now want to get the most out of these technologies in terms of productivity, design quality, and scalability. Software professionals with intermediate experience in Node.js and JavaScript will also find valuable the more advanced patterns and techniques presented in this book.
