Anyone can learn to do that easily, you just need the right framework to pair with the programming language of your choice! If you're interested in developing software for a diverse range of computers and operating systems, including Microsoft Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, MacOS, and Linux based operating systems like Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch Linux, etc. then electron is the right choice of framework for you. Learning Electron is a journey comprised of getting to know it's workflow, APIs, etc. Its easy enough to be learned just by reading Electron's documentation, however, if you wish to master the full power of Electron, you need to use it with all it's advanced features, complementing Electron-userland programs, and Typescript; This book can be used to assist you in your journey to learn and master desktop software development, and help you avoid the heartache that comes with the steep learning curve of Electron at it's full power.What you can find inside this book: You will find the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, ES6, and Electron, so you can easily get acquainted with it even if you have never used Electron or NodeJS before. The basics are thorough and dense in print, so even if you are an intermediate or advanced user, you can learn stuff you may have never seen before. Advanced features like Data-type Prejudice, Class Based OOP, Scaffolding, Boilerplate code, Crash Report handling, Working with I/O devices, Debugging, Testing, etc. are covered for intermediate and Advanced users. Heavy attention has been given to the practicals, demonstrations, and code narrations. Advanced coding practices are covered, and a wide range of alternatives and suggestions are provided to improve your overall experience with Electron and JavaScript. The lessons are presented in a way that enhances the learning experience when the book is used as a self-learning material. The explanations and code narrations are provide in a way that assists rote learning, if the need ever arises! The past and future of Desktop Applications is discussed at length, and an entire chapter is provided to inspire and inform readers who are interested in applying Electron and JavaScript to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Internet of Things, etc. Instructions are given to use Electron with both JavaScript and TypeScript. Instructions are given to extend your journey to program and develop using Electron beyond this book. A lot of informative material is provided to get you acquainted with the Electron-userland. This book will take care of all your Electron related needs! It will teach you all you need to learn, and it will tell you all you need to know!

This e-book is a gentler introduction to JavaScript. The real issues in learning JavaScript is either not understanding the basic concept clearly or overwhelmed by too much detailed learning resources. To encounter these issues, this e-book is created. It is a small book but the content is well balanced and focuses only on core JavaScript Programming area. The benefit of this book is extended to all groups from beginners to expert levels. If you are a visual learner, this book can be a great aid. Each and every component of JavaScript like loops, variables, built-in data structures and functions are made interactive with images and examples. The code for each function can be executed step-wise, and the output can be checked in real time. The book also shed some lights on OOPs concept to get a good grip over the language.

Then JavaScript may be the language for you. There is a lot of power and efficiency behind this coding language, but because it works with websites and online work, and HTML documents, many programmers are worried about working with it at all. They worry that it will be too hard to learn, won't have enough power to get the work done, or that they will find the tasks too difficult. But nothing could be further from the truth, and we are going to take some time in this guidebook to show you just how easy working with JavaScript can be for you. There are so many things we can learn about when it is time to pull out the JavaScript language, and this guidebook is going to help you go from beginner to advanced in no time at all. Some of the topics we will discuss inside of this guidebook will include: -A history lesson about JavaScript and what it can do for you. -Some of the basics that come with this coding language and how we can write some of our own codes. - A look at the different places on a web page where we can place our HTML code and get it to work well. - A look at statements and declarations -Working with the JavaScript variables. -Some of the basic operators and constructs that work with this language. -How to handle the different mathematical expressions that show up in your code. -How to handle JavaScript objects. -The frustration that can come up with handling dates and times, and some of the basic methods used to fix this issue. -Working with the Document Object Model, or DOM, to get more done. -The importance of classes and prototypes in this language. The JavaScript language is one of the best choices you can make when it is time to take your code and write it for web pages and other HTML documents. Learning how to work with it can really improve your websites, web pages, and other important things you want to do online.

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is part of the three major elements of modern web pages. The other two are Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. HTML defines the structure of web pages. HTML contains a lot of features and instructs the browser on how to display content. CSS is responsible for styling while JavaScript is a prototype-based language with top-notch functions utilized by web page authors to control element actions. The three major markup languages concepts are explained further in the book. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is an excellent way of designing web pages. With CSS, you determine the color of an element, angle, visibility, size, and position, and more. CSS can be utilized either within the document or as an independent file which must be referenced by the HTML document. CSS is a standard way of styling an individual or group of elements at once. There are many parts and tasks that come with the JavaScript language, and we are going to take some time to explore these a bit more. This will make it easier for us to see how this language works and what we can do with it. From learning how to write our own objects, expressions, operators, and more, this guidebook has all of the tools that you need in order to get started with writing some of our own codes in JavaScript.

This is not always as easy to choose as the others, but the number of features and capabilities that come with this language compared to some of the other options, especially when we are talking about using this on web pages, then JavaScript is the right choice for you. When you are ready to learn more about the JavaScript language and what you are able to do with it, make sure to check out this guidebook to help you get started. JavaScript is capable of acting on or influencing web pages. JavaScript enhances web user interface by confirming actions taken by the user on the client-side. JavaScript contains three data types, which are number, Boolean, and string. With JavaScript, you can describe the functions of your own.
