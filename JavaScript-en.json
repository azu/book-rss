Like Python Crash Course, this hands-on guide is a must-have for anyone who wants to learn how to code from the ground up—this time using the popular JavaScript programming language. Learn JavaScript—Fast! JavaScript Crash Course is a fun-filled, fast-paced introduction to programming with JavaScript. Dive right in and you’ll be writing code, solving problems, and building working web applications and games in no time. You’ll start by learning fundamental programming concepts, such as variables, arrays, objects, functions, conditionals, loops, classes, and more. Aided by engaging examples and hands-on exercises, you’ll build on this foundation and combine JavaScript with HTML and CSS to create interactive web applications that you can run right away. Then you’ll put your new skills into play with three substantial projects: a Pong-style game with a virtual opponent, an app that generates electronic music, and a platform for visualizing data fetched from an API. Along the way, you’ll learn how to: • Update web pages in real time by manipulating the Document Object Model • Trigger functions in response to events like key presses and mouse clicks • Generate graphics and animations with JavaScript and HTML’s Canvas element • Visualize data with the D3.js library and scalable vector graphics (SVG) • Make electronic music with Tone.js and the Web Audio API If you’ve been thinking about digging into programming, JavaScript Crash Course will get you writing real programs fast.
