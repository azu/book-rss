This book is filled with examples that enable you to leverage the latest JavaScript and TypeScript versions to produce modern and clean code, as well as teach you to how apply functional programming techniques to develop more efficient algorithms, write more concise code, and simplify unit testing. This book provides comprehensive coverage of the major topics in functional programming to produce shorter, clearer, and testable programs. You'll begin by getting to grips with writing and testing pure functions, reducing side effects, as well as other key features to make your applications functional in nature. The book specifically explores techniques to simplify coding, apply recursion, perform high-level coding, learn ways to achieve immutability, implement design patterns, and work with data types. By the end of this book, you'll have developed the practical programming skills needed to confidently enhance your applications by adding functional programming to wherever it's most suitable. What you will learn Understand when to use functional programming versus classic object-oriented programming Use declarative coding instead of imperative coding for clearer, more understandable code Know how to avoid side effects and create more reliable code with closures and immutable data Use recursion to help design and implement more understandable solutions to complex problems Define functional programing data types with or without TypeScript, add type checking, and implement immutability Apply advanced containers to get better structures to tackle errors and implement async programming Who this book is for If you are a JavaScript or TypeScript developer looking to enhance your programming skills, then this book is for you.

These aren’t just simple, contrived examples but real apps that you can choose to install on your servers and use for real. You’ll also understand how Docker can be used to run the apps you build in a clear and well-defined way, all of which will be able to springboard you into creating more advanced apps on your own. You'll see why React is one of the most popular web development tools available today, and why Node.js is also frequently used for server-side development. The fact that both utilize JavaScript is a big selling point, but there are shortcomings. Modern Full-Stack Development highlights how adding Django, Webpack, and Docker to the mix resolves any issues by creating a potent full development stack on which to build applications – two possible stacks, really!! What You'll Learn: Review the basics of TypeScript and writing both React and Node apps with it Construct a project with NPM and Webpack, configuration and usage Utilize client-side and server-side development Employ REST APIs and database usage across two tech stacks, Node and Python/Django Deploy apps using Docker Who This Book Is For: Web developers and software architects.",

This book highlights how Typescript works with JavaScript and its frameworks, giving it greater functionality, especially for larger enterprise projects. You'll start by reviewing some fundamentals such as how to run a TypeScript file and compile it to JavaScript as well as understand how it sits within the full ecosystem alongside React, Redux, Angular and Webpack. Using a practical project-led approach, you'll go through key concepts and aspects of Typescript such as compilers, arrays, classes and interfaces. Once you complete the fundamental basics, you'll move onto more complex topics like advanced types. You'll also learn about Decorators, which are a must-have feature in Angular. The book then presents a small To-do list project followed by a larger 'Drag and Drop' project. You'll see how to divide the drag and drop project into small manageable modules and learn to make the project more efficient with Webpack. Lastly, you'll create two more React projects, a party app with React and then one with React and Redux. Typescript Basics reveals how this JavaScript extension is currently the fastest growing language for web development with more and more developers and companies looking to utilize and adopt it within their current workflows and projects.
