Updated for the latest React release, the second edition of this hands-on guide shows you how to build React components and organize them into maintainable large-scale apps. If you're familiar with JavaScript syntax, you're ready to get started.

You'll quickly learn why some developers consider React the key to the web app development puzzle. Set up React and write your first \"Hello, World\" web app Create and use custom React components alongside generic DOM components Build a data table component that lets you edit, sort, search, and export its contents Master the JSX syntax Use built-in Hooks and create your own custom ones Manage the app's data flow with reducers and contexts Use Create React App to take care of the build process and focus on React itself Build a complete custom app that lets you store data on the client<br><blockquote>If you&#39;re familiar with JavaScript syntax, you&#39;re ready to get started.

The only technical requirement for using Blazor WebAssembly is a browser that supports WebAssembly, which, as of today, all modern browsers do. Blazor WebAssembly by Example is a project-based guide for learning how to build single-page web applications using the Blazor WebAssembly framework. This book emphasizes the practical over the theoretical by providing detailed step-by-step instructions for each project. You'll start by building simple standalone web applications and progress to developing more advanced hosted web applications with SQL Server backends. Each project covers a different aspect of the Blazor WebAssembly ecosystem, such as Razor components, JavaScript interop, event handling, application state, and dependency injection. The book is designed in such a way that you can complete the projects in any order. By the end of this book, you will have experience building a wide variety of single-page web applications with .NET, Blazor WebAssembly, and C#. What you will learn Discover the power of the C# language for both server-side and client-side web development Use the Blazor WebAssembly App project template to build your first Blazor WebAssembly application Use templated components and the Razor class library to build and share a modal dialog box Understand how to use JavaScript with Blazor WebAssembly Build a progressive web app (PWA) to enable native app-like performance and speed Understand dependency injection (DI) in .NET to build a shopping cart app Get to grips with .NET Web APIs by building a task manager app Who this book is for This book is for .NET web developers who are tired of constantly learning new JavaScript frameworks and wish to write web applications using Blazor WebAssembly, leveraging the power of .NET and C#. The book assumes beginner-level knowledge of the C# language, .NET framework, Microsoft Visual Studio, and web development concepts.<br><blockquote>By the end of this book, you will have experience building a wide variety of single-page web applications with .NET, Blazor WebAssembly, and C#.
