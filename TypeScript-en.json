TypeScript 4 Design Patterns and Best Practices will assist with understanding design patterns and learning best practices for producing scalable TypeScript applications. It will also serve as handy documentation for future maintainers. This book takes a hands-on approach to helping you get up and running with the implementation of TypeScript design patterns and associated methodologies for writing testable code. You'll start by exploring the practical aspects of TypeScript 4 and its new features. The book will then take you through traditional gang of four (GOF) design patterns, such as behavioral, creational, and structural in their classic and alternative forms, and show you how you can use them in real-world development projects. Once you've got to grips with traditional design patterns, you'll advance to learning about their functional programming and reactive programming counterparts and how they can be coupled to deliver better and more idiomatic TypeScript code. By the end of this TypeScript book, you'll be able to efficiently recognize when and how to use the right design patterns in any practical use case and gain the confidence to work on scalable and maintainable TypeScript projects of any size. What you will learn • Understand the role of design patterns and their significance • Explore all significant design patterns within the context of TypeScript • Find out how design patterns differ from design concepts • Understand how to put the principles of design patterns into practice • Discover additional patterns that stem from functional and reactive programming • Recognize common gotchas and antipatterns when developing TypeScript applications and understand how to avoid them Who this book is for If you're a developer looking to learn how to apply established design patterns to solve common programming problems instead of reinventing solutions, you'll find this book useful. You're not expected to have prior knowledge of design patterns. Basic TypeScript knowledge is all you need to get started with this book.

KEY FEATURES ● Includes real examples and numerous illustrated use-cases on how to build dynamic and interactive web applications. ● Covers true challenges faced by Angular professionals along with proven solutions and best practices. ● Discusses various kinds of best practices followed in Angular applications. ● Makes you travel through a journey of 20 stations. Each station comes with new excitement and new challenges. ● Covers practical examples with real-time discussions. DESCRIPTION This book is an exciting journey where novice developers learn everything they need to do before they start working on the Angular framework and develop dynamic web applications. The book begins with building a strong foundation on the concepts of web application development and numerous developer-friendly terminologies that you would often come across while learning Angular. It covers the essentials of ES6, Webpack, and TypeScript to write Angular applications and make the development of Angular apps more enticing, innovative, and scalable. The book talks about modules, directives, components, data binding, routing, and many more components and functions. Each of these topics is backed with real examples and illustrations. By the end of this book, you will learn about Angular’s powerful features and capabilities. You will become a confident developer to design your own modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications all by yourself using this single source of knowledge. WHAT YOU WILL LEARN ● Master fundamental concepts of Angular and it's Architecture. ● Witness the true potential of Angular for building composable components. ● Become well versed with the file and folder structure of an Angular application. ● Learn to write clean, simple and error-free codes like a sound professional developer. ● Learn the essentials of ES6, Typescript and Webpack to write angular applications..1.
