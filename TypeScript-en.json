Knowing the basics of React is important, but what is more important is knowing the common third-party libraries and how to use them. This book features popular libraries such as React Router v6 for route navigation, Redux with Saga and Thunk for state management, and Formik with Yup for form and input validations. You'll also work with Material UI 5 (the next major version of the most popular UI component library in React), Axios as the HTTP client library, JWT auth for client app authentication, and TypeScript. Finally, you'll learn to deploy the app to Netlify, and containerize the React app to ship it as a standalone container instance or in a Kubernetes cluster. Become a more effective React developer by using what is available out there instead of trying to reinvent the wheel. This book reveals how to save time and money, and build better apps for your clients. Get practical with React enterprise app development and enhance your career. What You'll Learn Use TypeScript in React Work with Redux, Saga, and Thunk, along with TypeScript Validate forms and inputs without writing too much code Use Material UI Secure the React app by building a login form and protecting the routes Who This Book Is For Those interested in writing React enterprise apps.

He begins by describing the TypeScript language and the benefits it offers and then shows you how to use TypeScript in real-world scenarios, including development with the DOM API, and popular frameworks such as Angular and React. He starts from the nuts-and-bolts and builds up to the most advanced and sophisticated features. Each topic is covered clearly and concisely, and is packed with the details you need to be effective. The most important features are given a no-nonsense, in-depth treatment and chapters include common problems and teach you how to avoid them.

With Deno Web Development, you'll learn all about Deno's primitives, its principles, and how you can use them to build real-world applications. The book is divided into three main sections: an introduction to Deno, building an API from scratch, and testing and deploying a Deno application. The book starts by getting you up to speed with Deno's runtime and the reason why it was developed. You'll explore some of the concepts introduced by Node, why many of them transitioned into Deno, and why new features were introduced. After understanding Deno and why it was created, you will start to experiment with Deno, exploring the toolchain and writing simple scripts and CLI applications. As you progress to the second section, you will create a simple web application and then add more features to it. This application will evolve from a simple 'hello world' API to a web application connected to the database, with users, authentication, and a JavaScript client. In the third section, the book will take you through topics such as dependency management, configuration and testing, finishing with an application deployed in a cloud environment. By the end of this web development book, you will become comfortable with using Deno to create, maintain, and deploy secure and reliable web applications. What You Will Learn: Understand why you should use Deno Get to grips with tooling and the Deno ecosystem Build Deno web applications using existing Node.js knowledge and the newest ECMA Script 6 features Explore the standard library and the benefits of Deno's security model Discover common practices and web frameworks to build a REST API in Deno Structure a web application using common architecture practices Test and deploy a Deno application in the cloud using Docker Who this book is for: This book is for developers who want to leverage their JavaScript and TypeScript skills in a secure, simple, and modern runtime, using Deno for web app development.
