This web app development book takes a hands-on, project-based approach to provide you with all the tools and techniques that web developers need to create, debug, and deploy efficient web applications using ASP.NET Core and Angular. The fifth edition has been updated to cover advanced topics such as Minimal APIs, Web APIs with GraphQL, real-time updates with SignalR, and new features in .NET 6 and Angular 13. You begin by building a data model with Entity Framework Core, alongside utilizing the Entity Core Fluent API and EntityTypeConfiguration class. You'll learn how to fetch and display data and handle user input with Angular reactive forms and front-end and back-end validators for maximum effect. Later, you will perform advanced debugging and explore the unit testing features provided by xUnit.net (.NET 6) and Jasmine, as well as Karma for Angular. After adding authentication and authorization to your apps, you will explore progressive web applications, learning about their technical requirements, testing processes, and how to convert a standard web application to a PWA.

TypeScript 4 Design Patterns and Best Practices will assist with understanding design patterns and learning best practices for producing scalable TypeScript applications. It will also serve as handy documentation for future maintainers. This book takes a hands-on approach to helping you get up and running with the implementation of TypeScript design patterns and associated methodologies for writing testable code. You'll start by exploring the practical aspects of TypeScript 4 and its new features. The book will then take you through traditional gang of four (GOF) design patterns, such as behavioral, creational, and structural in their classic and alternative forms, and show you how you can use them in real-world development projects. Once you've got to grips with traditional design patterns, you'll advance to learning about their functional programming and reactive programming counterparts and how they can be coupled to deliver better and more idiomatic TypeScript code. By the end of this TypeScript book, you'll be able to efficiently recognize when and how to use the right design patterns in any practical use case and gain the confidence to work on scalable and maintainable TypeScript projects of any size. What you will learn • Understand the role of design patterns and their significance • Explore all significant design patterns within the context of TypeScript • Find out how design patterns differ from design concepts • Understand how to put the principles of design patterns into practice • Discover additional patterns that stem from functional and reactive programming • Recognize common gotchas and antipatterns when developing TypeScript applications and understand how to avoid them Who this book is for If you're a developer looking to learn how to apply established design patterns to solve common programming problems instead of reinventing solutions, you'll find this book useful. You're not expected to have prior knowledge of design patterns. Basic TypeScript knowledge is all you need to get started with this book.

            "summary": "A detailed and easy-to-follow guide to learning design patterns and modern best practices for improving your TypeScript development skills Key Features • Understand, analyze, and develop classical design patterns in TypeScript • Explore advanced design patterns taken from functional programming and reactive programming • Discover useful techniques and gotchas when developing large-scale TypeScript applications Book Description TypeScript is a superset language on top of JavaScript that introduces type safety and enhanced developer tooling. TypeScript 4 Design Patterns and Best Practices will assist with understanding design patterns and learning best practices for producing scalable TypeScript applications. It will also serve as handy documentation for future maintainers.
