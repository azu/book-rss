React Native is an open-source JavaScript framework that allows you to create applications for many platforms, including iOS, Android, and the web, all with the same code base. It is built on the React framework, and it provides all of React’s power to mobile app development. React Native was a natural continuation of React. It is a mobile framework that includes JavaScript to create near-native apps. JSX, a hybrid of JavaScript and XML-like markup, is used to make React Native applications. The React Native “bridge” then calls the native rendering APIs in Objective-C (for iOS) or Java (for Android) behind the scenes (for Android). As a result, your app will appear and feel like any other mobile app, as it will be rendered using genuine mobile UI components instead of web views. React Native also offers JavaScript interfaces for platform APIs, allowing your React Native apps to use features such as user location and the phone camera. If your app is UI focused, React Native is an excellent choice because it comes with an extensive UI library. Becoming a React Native developer gives you access to exciting, cutting-edge projects which frequently incorporate innovative technology like Augmented Reality. Job opportunities for React Native devs are aplenty, and it is undoubtedly a skill worthy of consideration owing to its popularity with startups and corporates alike. With Mastering React Native, learning React Native becomes easy and will help readers undoubtedly advance their careers.

React is a JavaScript framework for creating interface design that is coherent, cheap, and customizable. It makes it possible to create complicated user interfaces out of “modules,” which are small, independent pieces of code. The primary goal of using React is the easier creation of visual interfaces. React was developed by Facebook and released to the public in 2013. It powers some of the most popular apps, including Facebook and Instagram. It uses virtual DOM (JavaScript Document Object Model), which increases the application’s performance. The virtualized DOM in JavaScript is faster than the conventional DOM. React can be used as both a standalone framework and in conjunction with other platforms. It employs component and data patterns to improve clarity while also assisting in maintaining larger applications. React saves you time and money during development because it is component-based. The design can be segmented into reusable modules that could be used to adjust interfaces dynamically. The front-end development industry has a reputation for moving at a breakneck speed. Organizations cannot be expected to modify their apps annually to catch pace with technological innovations. This is why businesses prefer React. React simplifies many things, and its ecosystem is full of valuable subframeworks and tools. React is among the most powerful front-end frameworks out there. As such, learning React development can future-proof anyone’s career in the long run, and even yield immediate benefits. This book explains the concepts of React in an easy-to-grasp language.

Software Design by Example: A Tool-Based Introduction with JavaScript therefore build small versions of the things programmers use in order to demystify them and give some insights into how experienced programmers think. From a file backup system and a testing framework to a regular expression matcher, a browser layout engine, and a very small compiler, we explore common design patterns, show how making code easier to test also makes it easier to re-use, and help readers understand how debuggers, profilers, package managers, and version control systems work so that they can use them more effectively. This material can be used for self-paced study, in an undergraduate course on software design, or as the core of an intensive week-long workshop for working programmers. Each chapter has a set of exercises ranging in size and difficulty from half a dozen lines to a full day's work. Readers should be familiar with the basics of modern JavaScript, but the more advanced features of the language are explained and illustrated as they are introduced.
