TypeScript 4 Design Patterns and Best Practices will assist with understanding design patterns and learning best practices for producing scalable TypeScript applications. It will also serve as handy documentation for future maintainers. This book takes a hands-on approach to helping you get up and running with the implementation of TypeScript design patterns and associated methodologies for writing testable code. You'll start by exploring the practical aspects of TypeScript 4 and its new features. The book will then take you through traditional gang of four (GOF) design patterns, such as behavioral, creational, and structural in their classic and alternative forms, and show you how you can use them in real-world development projects. Once you've got to grips with traditional design patterns, you'll advance to learning about their functional programming and reactive programming counterparts and how they can be coupled to deliver better and more idiomatic TypeScript code. By the end of this TypeScript book, you'll be able to efficiently recognize when and how to use the right design patterns in any practical use case and gain the confidence to work on scalable and maintainable TypeScript projects of any size. What you will learn • Understand the role of design patterns and their significance • Explore all significant design patterns within the context of TypeScript • Find out how design patterns differ from design concepts • Understand how to put the principles of design patterns into practice • Discover additional patterns that stem from functional and reactive programming • Recognize common gotchas and antipatterns when developing TypeScript applications and understand how to avoid them Who this book is for If you're a developer looking to learn how to apply established design patterns to solve common programming problems instead of reinventing solutions, you'll find this book useful. You're not expected to have prior knowledge of design patterns. Basic TypeScript knowledge is all you need to get started with this book.

You'll begin by learning how to build AWS Amplify solutions with React and React Native with TypeScript from scratch, along with integrating it with existing solutions. This book will show you the fastest way to build a production-ready minimum viable product (MVP) within days instead of years. You'll also discover how to increase development speed without compromising on quality by adopting behavior-driven development (BDD) and Cypress for end-to-end test automation, as well as the Amplify build pipeline (DevOps or CI/CD pipeline) to ensure optimal quality throughout continuous test automation and continuous delivery. As you advance, you'll work with React to determine how to build progressive web apps (PWAs) with Amplify and React Native for cross-platform mobile apps. In addition to this, you'll find out how to set up a custom domain name for your new website and set up the AWS Amplify Admin UI for managing the content of your app effectively.
