Then, there's ASP.NET Core 5, which is the fastest .NET web framework today. Together, Vue.js for the frontend and ASP.NET Core 5 for the backend make a powerful combination. This book follows a hands-on approach to implementing practical methodologies for building robust applications using ASP.NET Core 5 and Vue.js 3. The topics here are not deep dive and the book is intended for busy .NET developers who have limited time and want a quick implementation of a clean architecture with popular libraries. You’ll start by setting up your web app’s backend, guided by clean architecture, command query responsibility segregation (CQRS), mediator pattern, and Entity Framework Core 5. The book then shows you how to build the frontend application using best practices, state management with Vuex, Vuetify UI component libraries, Vuelidate for input validations, lazy loading with Vue Router, and JWT authentication. Later, you’ll focus on testing and deployment. All the tutorials in this book support Windows 10, macOS, and Linux users. By the end of this book, you’ll be able to build an enterprise full-stack web app, use the most common npm packages for Vue.js and NuGet packages for ASP.NET Core, and deploy Vue.js and ASP.NET Core to Azure App Service using GitHub Actions. What you will learnDiscover CQRS and mediator pattern in the ASP.NET Core 5 Web APIUse Serilog, MediatR, FluentValidation, and Redis in ASP.NETExplore common Vue.js packages such as Vuelidate, Vuetify, and VuexManage complex app states using the Vuex state management libraryWrite integration tests in ASP.NET Core using xUnit and FluentAssertionsDeploy your app to Microsoft Azure using the new GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)Who this book is for This app development book is for .NET developers who want to get started with Vue.js and build full-stack enterprise web applications. Web developers looking to build a proof-of-concept application quickly and pragmatically using their existing knowledge of ASP.NET Core as well as developers who want to write readable and maintainable code using TypeScript and the C# programming language will also find this book useful. The book assumes intermediate-level .NET knowledge along with an understanding of C# programming, JavaScript, and ECMAScript.<br><blockquote>This book follows a hands-on approach to implementing practical methodologies for building robust applications using ASP.NET Core 5 and Vue.js 3.</blockquote>",

            "summary": "A busy .NET developer's step-by-step guide to building fully functional, cloud-ready, and professional web apps without diving into the theory of frameworks and libraries Key FeaturesDiscover tenants of clean architecture in the latest ASP.NET Core 5 Web APIDevelop Vue.js 3 single-page applications (SPAs) using TypeScript and VuexLearn techniques to secure, test, and deploy your full-stack web apps on AzureBook Description Vue.js 3 is faster and smaller than the previous version, and TypeScript’s full support out of the box makes it a more maintainable and easier-to-use version of Vue.js. Then, there's ASP.NET Core 5, which is the fastest .NET web framework today. Together, Vue.js for the frontend and ASP.NET Core 5 for the backend make a powerful combination. This book follows a hands-on approach to implementing practical methodologies for building robust applications using ASP.NET Core 5 and Vue.js 3. The topics here are not deep dive and the book is intended for busy .NET developers who have limited time and want a quick implementation of a clean architecture with popular libraries. You’ll start by setting up your web app’s backend, guided by clean architecture, command query responsibility segregation (CQRS), mediator pattern, and Entity Framework Core 5. The book then shows you how to build the frontend application using best practices, state management with Vuex, Vuetify UI component libraries, Vuelidate for input validations, lazy loading with Vue Router, and JWT authentication. Later, you’ll focus on testing and deployment. All the tutorials in this book support Windows 10, macOS, and Linux users. By the end of this book, you’ll be able to build an enterprise full-stack web app, use the most common npm packages for Vue.js and NuGet packages for ASP.NET Core, and deploy Vue.js and ASP.NET Core to Azure App Service using GitHub Actions. What you will learnDiscover CQRS and mediator pattern in the ASP.NET Core 5 Web APIUse Serilog, MediatR, FluentValidation, and Redis in ASP.NETExplore common Vue.js packages such as Vuelidate, Vuetify, and VuexManage complex app states using the Vuex state management libraryWrite integration tests in ASP.NET Core using xUnit and FluentAssertionsDeploy your app to Microsoft Azure using the new GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)Who this book is for This app development book is for .NET developers who want to get started with Vue.js and build full-stack enterprise web applications. Web developers looking to build a proof-of-concept application quickly and pragmatically using their existing knowledge of ASP.NET Core as well as developers who want to write readable and maintainable code using TypeScript and the C# programming language will also find this book useful. The book assumes intermediate-level .NET knowledge along with an understanding of C# programming, JavaScript, and ECMAScript.",

This book provides all the tools you need to help you create advanced 3D graphics and GPU computing on the web with this new WebGPU API. The book starts by taking you through the WebPack-TypeScript template for building the WebGPU apps and then shows you the WebGPU basics, shader program, GPU buffer, and rendering pipeline. Next, you will learn how to create primitives and simple objects in WebGPU. As you progress through the chapters, you will get to grips with advanced WebGPU topics, including 3D transformation, lighting calculation, colormaps, and textures. At the same time, you will learn how to create advanced 3D WebGPU objects, including various 3D wireframes, 3D shapes, simple and parametric 3D surfaces with colormaps and textures, as well as 3D surface plots and fractal graphics described by complex functions. In addition, you will explore new WebGPU features, such as compute shader and storage buffer, and how to use them to simulate large particle systems. By the end of this book, you will have the skill you need to build your own GPU-accelerated graphics and computing on the web with the WebGPU API. The book includes: - Template based on WebPack and TypeScript for developing WebGPU apps. - WebGPU basics, GLSL and WGSL shaders, and rendering pipeline. - Create primitives and simple shapes in WebGPU. - 3D transformations, model, viewing, projection, and various coordinate systems. - GPU buffers, uniform buffer objects, animation, and camera controls. - Normal vectors, lighting model, ambient, diffuse, and specular light calculations. - UV coordinates, texture mapping.- Color model, colormaps, and color interpolation. - Create 3D shapes, wireframes, surfaces, and 3D charts. - Create 3D plots and fractal graphics using complex functions. - Compute shaders, storage buffers, and large particle system simulation.<br><blockquote>By the end of this book, you will have the skill you need to build your own GPU-accelerated graphics and computing on the web with the WebGPU API.
