Knowing the basics of React is important, but what is more important is knowing the common third-party libraries and how to use them. This book features popular libraries such as React Router v6 for route navigation, Redux with Saga and Thunk for state management, and Formik with Yup for form and input validations. You'll also work with Material UI 5 (the next major version of the most popular UI component library in React), Axios as the HTTP client library, JWT auth for client app authentication, and TypeScript. Finally, you'll learn to deploy the app to Netlify, and containerize the React app to ship it as a standalone container instance or in a Kubernetes cluster. Become a more effective React developer by using what is available out there instead of trying to reinvent the wheel. This book reveals how to save time and money, and build better apps for your clients. Get practical with React enterprise app development and enhance your career. What You'll Learn Use TypeScript in React Work with Redux, Saga, and Thunk, along with TypeScript Validate forms and inputs without writing too much code Use Material UI Secure the React app by building a login form and protecting the routes Who This Book Is For Those interested in writing React enterprise apps. Knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript/TypeScript is required, and experience with JavaScript libraries/frameworks would be useful.<br><blockquote>This book reveals how to save time and money, and build better apps for your clients.

By adding a strong type system to JavaScript, TypeScript can help you eliminate entire categories of runtime errors.

Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the technology Strong typing can eliminate nearly all errors caused by unanticipated data values. With TypeScript, an enhanced version of JavaScript, you can specify types and type annotations so your code is easier to read and far less likely to fail at runtime. And because the core of TypeScript is standard JavaScript, it runs on all major browsers and can be used with frameworks like Angular, Vue, and React. About the book TypeScript Quickly teaches you to exploit the benefits of types in browser-based and standalone applications. In this practical guide, you’ll build a fascinating blockchain service app that takes you through a range of type-sensitive programming techniques. As you go, you’ll also pick up valuable techniques for object-oriented programming with classes, interfaces, and advanced features such as decorators and conditional types.
