Spring Boot is the lightweight, nimbler cousin to the bigger Spring Framework, with plenty of \"bells and whistles.\" This updated edition includes coverage of Spring Native, which will help you speed up your Spring Boot applications, as well as messaging with Spring Boot, Spring GraphQL, Spring Data JDBC and reactive relational database connectivity (R2DBC) with SQL. This new edition also covers enhancements to actuator endpoints, MongoDB 4.0 support, layered JAR and WAR support, support to build OCI images using Cloud Native Build Packs, changes to the DataSource initialization mechanism, and how bean validation support has moved to a separate spring-boot-validation-starter module. This book will teach you how to work with relational and NoSQL databases for data accessibility using Spring Boot with Spring Data, how to persist data with the Java Persistence APIs (JPA), MyBatis, and much more. You'll learn how to enhance your native cloud or web applications with other APIs such as REST and how to build reactive web applications using Spring Boot with WebFlux. Finally, you'll learn how to test applications using JUnit 5, as well as how to secure and deploy your application or service to cloud providers like Heroku. After reading Beginning Spring Boot 3, you'll have the skills needed to start building your own Spring Boot cloud-native, Java-based applications and microservices with confidence, and to take the next steps in your career.
