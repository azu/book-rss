Learning Electron is a journey comprised of getting to know it's workflow, APIs, etc. Its easy enough to be learned just by reading Electron's documentation, however, if you wish to master the full power of Electron, you need to use it with all it's advanced features, complementing Electron-userland programs, and Typescript; This book can be used to assist you in your journey to learn and master desktop software development, and help you avoid the heartache that comes with the steep learning curve of Electron at it's full power.What you can find inside this book: You will find the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, ES6, and Electron, so you can easily get acquainted with it even if you have never used Electron or NodeJS before. The basics are thorough and dense in print, so even if you are an intermediate or advanced user, you can learn stuff you may have never seen before. Advanced features like Data-type Prejudice, Class Based OOP, Scaffolding, Boilerplate code, Crash Report handling, Working with I/O devices, Debugging, Testing, etc. are covered for intermediate and Advanced users. Heavy attention has been given to the practicals, demonstrations, and code narrations. Advanced coding practices are covered, and a wide range of alternatives and suggestions are provided to improve your overall experience with Electron and JavaScript. The lessons are presented in a way that enhances the learning experience when the book is used as a self-learning material. The explanations and code narrations are provide in a way that assists rote learning, if the need ever arises! The past and future of Desktop Applications is discussed at length, and an entire chapter is provided to inspire and inform readers who are interested in applying Electron and JavaScript to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Internet of Things, etc. Instructions are given to use Electron with both JavaScript and TypeScript. Instructions are given to extend your journey to program and develop using Electron beyond this book. A lot of informative material is provided to get you acquainted with the Electron-userland.

Then JavaScript may be the language for you. There is a lot of power and efficiency behind this coding language, but because it works with websites and online work, and HTML documents, many programmers are worried about working with it at all. They worry that it will be too hard to learn, won't have enough power to get the work done, or that they will find the tasks too difficult. But nothing could be further from the truth, and we are going to take some time in this guidebook to show you just how easy working with JavaScript can be for you. There are so many things we can learn about when it is time to pull out the JavaScript language, and this guidebook is going to help you go from beginner to advanced in no time at all. Some of the topics we will discuss inside of this guidebook will include: -A history lesson about JavaScript and what it can do for you. -Some of the basics that come with this coding language and how we can write some of our own codes. - A look at the different places on a web page where we can place our HTML code and get it to work well. - A look at statements and declarations -Working with the JavaScript variables. -Some of the basic operators and constructs that work with this language. -How to handle the different mathematical expressions that show up in your code. -How to handle JavaScript objects. -The frustration that can come up with handling dates and times, and some of the basic methods used to fix this issue. -Working with the Document Object Model, or DOM, to get more done. -The importance of classes and prototypes in this language. The JavaScript language is one of the best choices you can make when it is time to take your code and write it for web pages and other HTML documents.
