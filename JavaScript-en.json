Using examples of ReScript language features along with explanations of fundamental concepts in functional programming, this book will show web developers with a background in JavaScript how to effectively use ReScript to its full potential. In Introducing ReScript, you'll learn how to use features in ReScript that JavaScript lacks, such as type inference, null-safety, algebraic data types, pattern matching, and more. Along the way, you'll pick up functional programming concepts like immutability and higher-order functions. You'll also gain a sense of how ReScript works under the hood and how to leverage interoperability between ReScript and JavaScript. Whether you're a web developer interested in dabbling with functional programming or you just want to learn how to write safer and cleaner code for web applications, this book is a great way for you to get started with ReScript. What You Will Learn Use ReScript to write clean, safe, and elegant software Understand the features of ReScript that set it apart from JavaScript, such as type inference, null-safety, and algebraic data types Explore functional programming concepts like immutabhigher-orderr order functions, and pattern matching Use popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks in your ReScript code and integrate ReScript code into JavaScript codebases Who This Book Is For Web developers that want a strictly typed, safer alternative to JavaScript, as well as web developers interested in learning functional programming and leveraging the elegant and powerful functional features in ReScript.<br><blockquote>This book serves as a succinct guide on ReScript, a functional language for building web applications.</blockquote>",

Vue is a popular JavaScript front-end framework that is rapidly expanding. It is easy to use, small (less than 24 KB), and really fast. It is simple to include in other applications and libraries. Vue.js is easy to install, and beginners may quickly learn how to use it and begin creating their interface design. What makes Vue special is that it is different from most other JavaScript frameworks and libraries. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is built from the ground up to be incrementally adaptable. The core library focuses primarily on the View layer, and is easy to use and combine with other libraries or projects. On the other hand, when merged with contemporary stacks and libraries, Vue is perfectly capable of running powerful Single-Page Web Applications. Working with Vue.js can be fun. Leveraging Vue and its plugins can help one easily create excellent Internet and smartphone-compatible applications. Vue is both compact and customizable, and comes with multiple capabilities for intelligent state management and navigation choices. All said and done, learning Vue is an excellent career initiative, especially since it is rapidly gaining favor among startups and established enterprises alike. Vue is an excellent choice if you want to make a highly engaging, flexible, and data-driven app. It has an easy-to-understand layout which you can learn in minutes. Unlike Angular or React, Vue.js does not have a lot of challenges or concepts to master. It is an excellent choice for programmers looking to learn and implement new technology for their next project. With Mastering Vue.js, learning Vue becomes very straightforward, which will help readers undoubtedly advance their careers.

The book covers D3 concepts such as selections, joins, requests, scale functions, event handling and transitions. It also covers general web development techniques such as state management and modularisation. In other words, everything you need to know to build a real world, custom data visualisation. You'll also learn how to put these concepts into practice by building an interactive data visualisation called Energy Explorer. This is a custom data visualisation that visualises the energy mix of 141 countries. There are 15 separate build steps and you're taken through each step in detail. There's also a code download link for all 15 steps so you can follow along. Some of the topics covered are: - requesting CSV data using D3 - D3 data joins (including joining nested data) - architecting a data visualisation using a layout function - detailed styling using CSS - adding a popup using Flourish's popup library - state management - animations using D3 transitions - data manipulation using Lodash - adding a menu, legend and footer About the author Peter Cook has built data visualisations for Carbon Tracker, London Datastore and McGraw Hill Education. He currently works as a senior visualisation developer at Flourish and also writes about the how-to of data visualisation for Create With Data. He's run training courses for clients such as the BBC and The Economist and written data visualisation tutorials for Flowing Data and Creative Bloq. He created D3 in Depth and Create With Data.
